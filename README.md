## Following Along the Manuscript
Along the manuscript, you will find some Github logos, these are mainly hyperlinks to this repo. Each links in the figures caption links directly to the Jupyter notebook used for this figure. You can freely download the source code and play with it. If you have any problem using the source code or any information missing, feel free to contact me at this [address](mailto:lavaudmaxime.ml@gmail.com), or tu use the [discussion](https://github.com/eXpensia/Confined-Brownian-Motion/discussions) and [issues](https://github.com/eXpensia/Confined-Brownian-Motion/issues) sections.

## Installing Python

If you do not have python installed and want to follow along, I advise you to install it using mini-Conda.
The easiest way to install it is detailed on their [website](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

Any missing package can then be installed in one command line:

```
conda install package_name
```
