# Confined Brownian Motion
Welcome to my PhD thesis repository. You can go to the release to find the last manuscript version, or download the pdf file at the root directory.

## Following Along the Manuscript
Along the manuscript, you will find some Githubs logos, these are mainly hyperlinks to this repo. Each links in the figures caption links directly to the Jupyter notebook used for this figure. You can freely download the source code and play with it. If you have any problem using the source code or any information missing, feel free to contact me at this address.

## Instaling Python

If don't have python installed and want to follow along, I advise you to install it using Anaconda.
