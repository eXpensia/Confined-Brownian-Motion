	abstract = {Given a theoretical model for a self-propelled particle or micro-organism, how does one optimally determine the parameters of the model from experimental data in the form of a time-lapse recorded trajectory? For very long trajectories, one has very good statistics, and optimality may matter little. However, for biological micro-organisms, one may not control the duration of recordings, and then optimality can matter. This is especially the case if one is interested in individuality and hence cannot improve statistics by taking population averages over many trajectories. One can learn much about this problem by studying its simplest case, pure diﬀusion with no self-propagation. This is an interesting problem also in its own right for the very same reasons: interest in individuality and short trajectories. We summarize our recent results on this latter issue here and speculate about the extent to which similar results may be obtained also for self-propelled particles.},

The diversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We present such a model where there is diffusivity memory but no direction memory in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear {MSD} and a non-Gaussian G(x,t) at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is undergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression “diffusing diffusivity”. G(x,t) is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if the distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential remains a good fit for a variety of diffusivity distributions. Moreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.},

	abstract = {Background
Experimental results are commonly fitted by determining parameter values of suitable mathematical expressions. In case a relation exists between different data sets, the accuracy of the parameters obtained can be increased by incorporating this relationship in the fitting process instead of fitting the recordings separately.

Methods
An algorithm to fit multiple measured curves simultaneously was developed. The method accounts for parameters that are shared by some curves. It can be applied to either linear or nonlinear equations. Simulated noisy "measurement results" were created to compare the introduced method to the "straight forward" way of fitting the curves separately.

Results
The analysis of the simulated measurements confirm, that the introduced method yields more accurate parameters compared to the ones gained by fitting the measurements separately. Therefore it needs more computer time. As an example, the new fitting algorithm is applied to the measurements of the evoked compound action potentials ({ECAP}) of the auditory nerve: This leads to promising ideas to reduce artefacts generated by the measuring process.

Conclusion
The introduced fitting algorithm uses the relationship between multiple measurement results to increase the accuracy of the parameters. Its application in the field of {ECAP} measurements is promising and should be further investigated.},

	abstract = {We study the motion of a spherical particle driven by a constant volume force in a confined channel with a fixed square cross-section. The channel is filled with a mixture of two liquids under the effect of thermal fluctuations. We use the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate a fluctuating multicomponent fluid in the mixed-phase, and particle-fluid interactions are tuned to reproduce different wetting properties at the particle surface. The numerical set-up is first validated in the absence of thermal fluctuations; to this aim, we quantitatively compute the drift velocity at changing the particle radius and compare it with previous experimental and numerical data. In the presence of thermal fluctuations, we study the fluctuations in the particle's velocity at changing thermal energy, applied force, particle size, and particle wettability. The importance of fluctuations with respect to the mean drift velocity is quantitatively assessed, especially in comparison to unconfined situations. Results show that confinement strongly enhances the importance of velocity fluctuations, which can be one order of magnitude larger than what expected in unconfined domains. The observed findings underscore the versatility of the lattice Boltzmann simulations in concrete applications involving the motion of colloidal particles in a highly confined environment in the presence of thermal fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Strongly adsorbed polyelectrolytes are central in the conditioning properties of many personal care products. Whereas the mechanism of polymer adsorption is rather well understood, less is known about the actual mechanism of polyelectrolyte lubrication. We investigated the adsorption on mica and the lubricant properties of a strong polyelectrolyte, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), {polyDADMAC}, in aqueous solutions of diﬀerent salt concentrations. We found that the adsorption of the polymer was enhanced and the morphology of the adsorbed layer modiﬁed by increasing salt concentration. The lubricant properties of the adsorbed polyelectrolyte layer were good at low compressions but rapidly deteriorated at larger applied pressure. A complex velocity dependence of the friction was observed, with a maximum value at intermediate velocities and hysteresis in an acceleration/ deceleration cycle. A progressive increase in separation between the rubbing surfaces with velocity was also observed. We developed a model that describes the complex behavior of friction observed, taking into account the hysteretic elastic deformation of the polymer layer under shear and the dilatency due to the elastohydrodynamic eﬀects resulting from its low elastic modulus. Our results can help to explain the signiﬁcant lasting of the lubricating properties when {polyDADMAC} is used in conditioners, where polymer-lubricated hair-hair contacts exhibit low shear forces.},

We present a simple model based on a discrete approach that predicts the nature of these patterns and their non-trivial scheme of arrangement in a sequence as a function of the ratio of the two timescales of the problem, the production times of droplets and drops.

Here, by coupling microfluidic experiments, theory, and numerics, we succeed in unravelling the problem for the case of straight channels at high salinity. We discover a broad regime of deposition (the van der Waals regime) in which particle–wall van der Waals interactions govern the deposition mechanism. We determine the range of existence of the regime, for which we calculate the concentration profiles, retention profiles, and deposition kinetics analytically. The retention profiles decay as the inverse of the square root of the distance from the entry, and the deposition kinetics are given by the expression S≈(A2.1kT{ξL})1/2, where S is a dimensionless deposition function, A is the Hamaker constant, and ξL is a dimensionless parameter characterizing fluid flow properties. These findings are well supported by numerics. Experimentally, we find that the retention profiles behave as x–0.5±0.1 (where x is the distance from the channel entry) over three decades in scale, as predicted theoretically. By varying the flow conditions (speed, geometry, surface properties, and concentration) so as to cover four decades in ξL and taking the Hamaker constant as a free parameter, we accurately confirm the theoretical expression for the deposition kinetics. Operating in the van der Waals regime enables control of the deposition rates via surface chemistry. From a surface science perspective, working in the van der Waals regime enables us to measure the Hamaker constants of thousands of particles in a few minutes, a task that would take a much longer time to perform with standard {AFM}.},

Our results are applicable to a wide range of physical problems, from a protein diffusing in a membrane to the dispersion of a passive tracer in a random potential. In the case of passive diffusion in a scalar field, we show that the coupling to the field can, in some cases, speed up the diffusion corresponding to a form of stochastic resonance.

Various microfluidic approaches have been devised to mimic traversal in vitro by measuring the time required for cells to pass through a constriction. Although a cell’s passage time is expected to depend on its deformability, measurements from existing approaches are confounded by a cell's size and its frictional properties with the channel wall. Here, we introduce a device that enables the precise measurement of (i) the size of a single cell, given by its buoyant mass, (ii) the velocity of the cell entering a constricted microchannel (entry velocity), and (iii) the velocity of the cell as it transits through the constriction (transit velocity). Changing the deformability of the cell by perturbing its cytoskeleton primarily alters the entry velocity, whereas changing the surface friction by immobilizing positive charges on the constriction's walls primarily alters the transit velocity, indicating that these parameters can give insight into the factors affecting the passage of each cell. When accounting for cell buoyant mass, we find that cells possessing higher metastatic potential exhibit faster entry velocities than cells with lower metastatic potential. We additionally find that some cell types with higher metastatic potential exhibit greater than expected changes in transit velocities, suggesting that not only the increased deformability but reduced friction may be a factor in enabling invasive cancer cells to efficiently squeeze through tight spaces.},

The mechanisms underlying durotaxis are still unresolved, but generally believed to involve active sensing and locomotion. Here, we show that simple liquid droplets also undergo durotaxis. By modulating substrate stiffness, we obtain fine control of droplet position on soft, flat substrates. Unlike other control mechanisms, droplet durotaxis works without imposing chemical, thermal, electrical, or topographical gradients.

In this chapter, we review the Brownian motion of a particle moving in the vicinity of a living cell whose membrane is endowed with a resistance towards shear and bending. The analytical calculations proceed through the computation of the frequency-dependent mobility functions and the application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Elastic interfaces endow the system with memory effects that lead to a long-lived anomalous subdiffusive regime of nearby particles. In the steady limit, the diffusional behavior approaches that near a no-slip hard wall. The analytical predictions are validated and supplemented with boundary-integral simulations.},

	abstract = {Recent molecular dynamics simulations of glass-forming liquids revealed superdiffusive fluctuations associated with the position of a tracer particle ({TP}) driven by an external force. Such an anomalous response, whose mechanism remains elusive, has been observed up to now only in systems close to their glass transition, suggesting that this could be one of its hallmarks. Here, we show that the presence of superdiffusion is in actual fact much more general, provided that the system is crowded and geometrically confined. We present and solve analytically a minimal model consisting of a driven {TP} in a dense, crowded medium in which the motion of particles is mediated by the diffusion of packing defects, called vacancies. For such nonglass-forming systems, our analysis predicts a long-lived superdiffusion which ultimately crosses over to giant diffusive behavior. We find that this trait is present in confined geometries, for example long capillaries and stripes, and emerges as a universal response of crowded environments to an external force. These findings are confirmed by numerical simulations of systems as varied as lattice gases, dense liquids, and granular fluids.},

The fluctuation−dissipation theorem shows that the velocity autocorrelation function of the Brownian particle can be calculated from the frequency-dependent admittance valid locally. It is shown that the t-3/2 long-time tail of the velocity relaxation function, valid in bulk fluid, is obliterated and replaced by a t-5/2 long-time tail of positive amplitude for motions parallel to the wall and by a t-5/2 long-time tail of negative amplitude for motions perpendicular to the wall.

We explore this in a minimal setting by considering a fluid-immersed negatively buoyant cylinder moving along a soft inclined wall. Our experiments show that there is an emergent robust steady-state sliding regime of the cylinder with an effective friction that is significantly reduced relative to that of rigid fluid-lubricated contacts. A simple scaling approach that couples the cylinder-induced flow to substrate deformation allows us to explain the elastohydrodynamic lift that underlies the self-sustained lubricated motion of the cylinder, consistent with recent theoretical predictions. Our results suggest an explanation for a range of effects such as reduced wear in animal joints and long-runout landslides, and can be couched as a design principle for low-friction interfaces.},

	abstract = {It is known that an object translating parallel to a soft wall in a viscous fluid produces hydrodynamic stresses that deform the wall, which in turn results in a lift force on the object. Recent experiments with cylinders sliding under gravity near a soft incline, which confirmed theoretical arguments for the lift force, also reported an unexplained steady-state rotation of the cylinders [B. Saintyves et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA} 113, 5847 (2016)]. Motivated by these observations, we show, in the lubrication limit, that an infinite cylinder that translates in a viscous fluid parallel to a soft wall at constant speed and separation distance must also rotate in order to remain free of torque. Using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we show analytically that for small deformations of the elastic layer, the angular velocity of the cylinder scales with the cube of the sliding speed. These predictions are confirmed numerically. We then apply the theory to the gravity-driven motion of a cylinder near a soft incline and find qualitative agreement with the experimental observations, namely, that a softer elastic layer results in a greater angular speed of the cylinder.},

	abstract = {An optical technique for measuring the thickness of thin films has been adapted and evaluated for studying the structure of the adhesion of cells to glass in tissue culture. This technique, which is termed interference reflection microscopy, has been used to study embryonic chick heart fibroblasts. These findings have been observed: in normal culture medium the closest approach of the cell surface to substrate in its adhesions is ca. 100 A, much of the cell surface lying farther away; chemical treatments which bring the cell surface to near its charge reversal point reduce the closest approach of adhesions to {\textless}50 A, probably to {\textless}30 A; chemical treatments which increase surface charge increase the nearest approach of cell and substrate in adhesions from ca. 100 A; high osmotic concentration of a non-polar substance, i.e. sucrose, does not affect the distance between cell and substrate in the adhesions. In addition, optical evidence indicates that there is no extracellular material between cell and glass in the adhesions. When cells de-adhere from glass, they appear not to leave fragments behind. The adhesive sites in these fibroblasts appear to be confined to the edge of the side of the cell facing the substrate and to the pseudopods. The significance of this is discussed in relation to the phenomenon of contact inhibition. Evidence is presented that the mechanism of cell adhesion does not involve calcium atoms binding cells to substrate by combining with carboxyl groups on cell surface, substrate, and with a cement substance. Osmium tetroxide fixation results in a final separation of 100 to 200 A between cell and substrate: there are reasons for thinking that this fairly close approach to the condition in life is produced as an artefact. The results can be accounted for only in terms of the action of electrostatic repulsive forces and an attractive force, probably the van der Waals-London forces. Biological arguments suggest that these results are equally applicable for cell-to-cell adhesions.},

	abstract = {Adhesion can be quantified by measuring the distance between the interacting surfaces. Reflection interference contrast microscopy ({RICM}), with its ability to measure inter-surface distances under water with nanometric precision and milliseconds time resolution, is ideally suited to studying the dynamics of adhesion in soft systems. Recent technical developments, which include innovative image analysis and the use of multi-coloured illumination, have led to renewed interest in this technique. Unambiguous quantitative measurements have been achieved for colloidal beads and model membranes, thus revealing new insights and applications. Quantification of data from cells shows exciting prospects. Herein, we review the basic principles and recent developments of {RICM} applied to studies of dynamical adhesion processes in soft matter and cell biology and provide practical hints to potential users.},

	abstract = {This chapter describes reflection interference contrast microscopy ({RICM}). The term “{RICM}” is used in the chapter to cover all optical configurations and practical applications of the method. The method by which the light reflected from a semitransparent, epi-illuminated specimen contributes to the image formation in a microscope has been given different names, depending on details of the optical configuration of the microscope and on the particular application. It was introduced into cell biology by Curtis using the name “interference reflection microscopy” ({IRM}), and this name, or its variant, “reflection interference microscopy” ({RIM}), is often used in studies of adhesion of living cells. Ploem used the term “reflection contrast microscopy” ({RCM}) on the introduction of the antiflex method to increase image contrast. In {RICM} of living cells, reflections from the cell plasma membrane and intracellular membranes contribute to the image formation by interfering with each other and with the light reflected from the interface between the underlying glass surface and the liquid medium.},

	abstract = {Even though scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) is now needed to identify some species of diatoms, the majority of identifications and quantification of these organisms in ecological works is accomplished with a light microscope, using transmitted light optical methods. In this paper we demonstrate the use of interference reflection contrast (incident light) for the examination of diatoms, a method that significantly improves the resolution of structural detail, and therefore, identification of diatom taxa with light microscopy. Using incident light we were routinely able to distinguish between structures that were close to the theoretical limit of resolution for visible light, and that were not resolvable with such standard transmitted light techniques as phase contrast and differential interference contrast ({DIC}). Light microscopes with epi-illumination light paths can be easily and inexpensively outfitted to use this simple technique.

	abstract = {Reflection contrast microscopy ({RCM}), which utilizes the optical phenomena caused by oblique epi-illumination in combination with a specific optical apparatus, provides an approach for exploring biological phenomena in greater detail. The lack of stray reflection makes it superior to other microscopes. It bridges light and electron microscopic capabilities by allowing the analysis of ultrathin sections beyond the usual light microscopic magnification. By using consecutive image analysis, quantitation can be achieved. The wide range of applications of {RCM} can be combined with most microscopical techniques, so extending the spectrum of information that can be gathered. Twenty-five years after the development of {RCM}, there is still scope for its application in modern cell biology.},

	abstract = {We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, {GW}151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ({LIGO}) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 {UTC}. The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered {GW}151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5σ. The signal persisted in the {LIGO} frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of 3.4+0.7−0.9×10−22. The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are 14.2+8.3−3.7M⊙ and 7.5+2.3−2.3M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 20.8+6.1−1.7M⊙. We find that at least one of the component black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity distance of 440+180−190 Mpc corresponding to a redshift of 0.09+0.03−0.04. All uncertainties define a 90\% credible interval. This second gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar populations and on deviations from general relativity.},

At sufficiently short time intervals, the evolution of a normal mode is well described by a one-dimensional Smoluchowski equation with constant drift velocity v, and diffusion coefficent D. By virtue of fluctuation dissipation, these transport coefficients are simply related to conservative forces, F, acting on the normal mode: F={kBTv}/D. This relationship implicitly accounts for hydrodynamic interactions, requires no mechanical calibration, makes no assumptions about the form of conservative forces, and requires no prior knowledge of material properties. We apply this method to measure the electrostatic interactions of polymer microspheres suspended in nonpolar microemulsions.},

Exploring the “zero shear rate” limit, it rules out shear rate threshold to slip effects and extends the range over which slip lengths are shown to be flow independent. Avoiding the nucleation of gas pockets (nanobubbles) through external forcing, it validates the theoretical picture for intrinsic liquid-solid interfaces, reporting nanometric slip lengths (b=18±5 nmb=18±5 nm) only in nonwetting situations, opening the route to quantitative study on more complex surfaces with combined effects of nonwettability and roughness.},

	abstract = {Scientists today have completely different ideas of what machines can learn to do than we had only 10 y ago.

In image processing, speech and video processing, machine vision, natural language processing, and classic two-player games, in particular, the state-of-the-art has been rapidly pushed forward over the last decade, as a series of machine-learning performance records were achieved for publicly organized challenge problems. In many of these challenges, the records now meet or exceed human performance level.

A contest in 2010 proved that the Go-playing computer software of the day could not beat a strong human Go player. Today, in 2020, no one believes that human Go players—including human world champion Lee Sedol—can beat {AlphaGo}, a system constructed over the last decade. These new performance records, and the way they were achieved, obliterate the expectations of 10 y ago. At that time, human-level performance seemed a long way off and, for many, it seemed that no technologies then available would be able to deliver such performance.

Systems like {AlphaGo} benefited in this last decade from a completely unanticipated simultaneous expansion on several fronts. On the one hand, we saw the unprecedented availability of on-demand scalable computing power in the form of cloud computing, and on the other hand, a massive industrial investment in assembling human engineering teams from a globalized talent pool by some of the largest global technology players. These resources were steadily deployed over that decade to allow rapid expansions in challenge problem performance.

The 2010s produced a true technology explosion, a one-time–only transition: The sudden public availability of massive image and text data. Billions of people posted trillions of images and documents on social media, as the phrase “Big Data” entered media awareness. Image processing and natural language processing were forever changed by this new data resource …

	abstract = {Interest in Brownian motion was shared by different communities: this phenomenon was first observed by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827, then theorised by physicists in the 1900s, and eventually modelled by mathematicians from the 1920s, while still evolving as a physical theory. Consequently, Brownian motion now refers to the natural phenomenon but also to the theories accounting for it. There is no published work telling its entire history from its discovery until today, but rather partial histories either from 1827 to Perrin’s experiments in the late 1900s, from a physicist’s point of view; or from the 1920s from a mathematician’s point of view. In this article, we tackle the period straddling the two ‘half-histories’ just mentioned, in order to highlight continuity, to investigate the domain-shift from physics to mathematics, and to survey the enhancements of later physical theories. We study the works of Einstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin, Wiener, Ornstein and Uhlenbeck from 1905 to 1934 as well as experimental results, using the concept of Brownian velocity as a leading thread. We show how Brownian motion became a research topic for the mathematician Wiener in the 1920s, why his model was an idealization of physical experiments, what Ornstein and Uhlenbeck added to Einstein’s results, and how Wiener, Ornstein and Uhlenbeck developed in parallel contradictory theories concerning Brownian velocity.},

However, the measured {MSDs} in the z direction deviate substantially from the theory particularly for the case of smaller particles of 50 and 100 nm radius. Since the theory considers only the hydrodynamic interaction of moving particles with a stationary solid wall, additionally possible interaction forces like gravitational forces, van der Waals forces, and electro-osmotic forces have been examined to delineate the physical reasons for the discrepancy.},

	abstract = {This review addresses a central question in the field of complex systems: given a fluctuating (in time or space), sequentially measured set of experimental data, how should one analyze the data, assess their underlying trends, and discover the characteristics of the fluctuations that generate the experimental traces? In recent years, significant progress has been made in addressing this question for a class of stochastic processes that can be modeled by Langevin equations, including additive as well as multiplicative fluctuations or noise. Important results have emerged from the analysis of temporal data for such diverse fields as neuroscience, cardiology, finance, economy, surface science, turbulence, seismic time series and epileptic brain dynamics, to name but a few. Furthermore, it has been recognized that a similar approach can be applied to the data that depend on a length scale, such as velocity increments in fully developed turbulent flow, or height increments that characterize rough surfaces. A basic ingredient of the approach to the analysis of fluctuating data is the presence of a Markovian property, which can be detected in real systems above a certain time or length scale. This scale is referred to as the Markov–Einstein ({ME}) scale, and has turned out to be a useful characteristic of complex systems. We provide a review of the operational methods that have been developed for analyzing stochastic data in time and scale. We address in detail the following issues: (i) reconstruction of stochastic evolution equations from data in terms of the Langevin equations or the corresponding Fokker–Planck equations and (ii) intermittency, cascades, and multiscale correlation functions.},

Two cases are considered: (i) the plane surface is rigid and fluid adheres to its surface; (ii) the plane is a free surface on which the tangential stresses vanish. Deformation of the surface in the latter case is neglected. Numerical results are provided for the corrections to Stokes' law necessitated by the presence of the plane boundary at a finite distance from the particle. Application of the results to end-effect correlations in the falling-ball viscometer are discussed.
Résumé
Des coordonnées bipolaires sont utilisées pour obtenir des solutions “exactes” des équations relatives à l'écoulement lent et visqueux d'une sphére solide en mouvement uniforme au voisinage ou à distance d'une surface plane infinie. Deux cas sont considérés: (1) La surface plane est rigide et le fluide y adhère; ({II}) elle est libre et les forces tangentielles disparaissent. On néglige dans ce dernier cas la déformation de la surface. Des résultats numériques sont donnés pour les corrections de la loi de Stokes nécessitées par la présence d'un plan de séparation à une distance finie de la particule. Suit une discussion de l'application des résultats aux relations donnant l'effect des extrémités dans les viscosimètres à chute de bille.
Zusammenfassung
Mit Polarkoordinaten werden “exakte” Lösengun der Gleichungen für langsames viskoses Fliessen für die stationäre Bewegung einer festen Kugel gegen eine ebene, unendlich grosse Oberfläche, oder von ihr hinweg, erhalten. Es werden zwei Fälle betrachtet: (I) Die ebene Oberfläche ist fest und mit Flüssigkeit behaftet; ({II}) Es liegt eine freie Oberfläche vor, in der die Tangentialspannungen verschwinden. In diesem Fall wird die Verformung der Oberfläche vernachlässigy. Numerische Ergebnisse werden angegeben zur Korrektur des Stokes'schen Gesetzes, die infolge der Gegenwart einer ebenen Grenzfläche in endlicher Entfernung von dem Teilchen notwendig ist. Die Anwendung der Ergebnisse zur Korrektur von Endeffekten im Kugelviskosimeter wird diskutiert.},

The outstanding force resolution level is provided by the large size of the statistical ensemble built by recording all displacements from all diffusing particles, regardless of trajectory and time. This is only possible because the noise driving the particles is thermal, white, and stationary, so that the colloidal system is ergodic, as we carefully verify. Using an ergodic colloidal dispersion for performing ultrasensitive measurements of external forces is not limited to nonconservative optical force fields. Our experiments therefore give way to interesting opportunities in the context of weak force measurements in fluids.},

	abstract = {During the last 10 years, we have developed a new experimental technique called Total Internal Reflection Microscopy. Using {TIRM} we can monitor the separation distance between a single microscopic sphere immersed in an aqueous solution and a transparent plate. Because the distance is calculated from the intensity of light scattered by the sphere (3–30 μm in diameter) when illuminated by an evanescent wave, this technique provides a sensitive, non-intrusive, and instantaneous measure of the distance between the sphere and the plate. Changes in distance as small as 1 nm can be detected. From the equilibrium distribution of separation distances sampled by Brownian motion, we determine the potential energy profile in the vicinity of the minimum formed by gravitational attraction and double-layer repulsion or steric repulsion caused by an adsorbed soluble polymer. Forces as small as 0.01 {pN} can be detected. We have also measured van der Waals attraction, the radiation pressure exerted by a focused laser beam, receptor-mediated interaction between antigen and antibodies, and steric repulsion due to adsorbed polymer layers. From the autocorrelation of the temporal fluctuations in scattering intensity, we have inferred the value of the normal component of the diffusion coefficient, which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk value owing to the close proximity of the sphere to the wall. This provides the first experimental test of Einstein’s equation (relating mobility and diffusion coefficient) in a colloidal force field.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address shortcomings of the method of exponential basis functions by extending it to general linear and non-linear problems. In linear problems, the solution is approximated using a linear combination of exponential functions. The coefficients are calculated such that the homogenous form of equation is satisfied on some grid. To solve non-linear problems, they are converted to into a succession of linear ones using a Newton–Kantorovich approach. The generalized exponential basis functions ({GEBF}) method developed can be implemented with greater ease compared with exponential basis functions, as all calculations can be performed using real numbers and no characteristic equation is needed. The details of an optimized implementation are described. We compare {GEBF} on some benchmark problems with methods in the literature, such as variants of the boundary element method, where {GEBF} shows a good performance. Also, in a 3D problem, we report the run time of the proposed method compared with that of Kratos, a parallel, highly optimized finite element code. The results show that in this example, to obtain the same level of error, much less computational effort is needed in the proposed method. Practical limitations might be encountered, however, for large problems because of dense matrix operations involved. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Particularly extensive coverage of spectral analysis (detecting and measuring periodic signals) includes a self-contained introduction to Fourier and discrete Fourier methods. There is a chapter devoted to Bayesian inference with Poisson sampling, and three chapters on frequentist methods help to bridge the gap between the frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

We capture digital holograms of micrometer-scale silica rods and sub-micrometer-scale Janus particles freely diﬀusing in water, and then ﬁt numerical scattering models based on the discrete dipole approximation to the measured holograms. This inverse-scattering approach allows us to extract the position and orientation of the particles as a function of time, along with static parameters including the size, shape, and refractive index. The best-ﬁt sizes and refractive indices of both particles agree well with expected values. The technique is able to track the center of mass of the rod to a precision of 35 nm and its orientation to a precision of 1.5◦, comparable to or better than the precision of other 3D diﬀusion measurements on non-spherical particles. Furthermore, the measured translational and rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcients for the silica rods agree with hydrodynamic predictions for a spherocylinder to within 0.3\%. We also show that although the Janus particles have only weak optical asymmetry, the technique can track their 2D translation and azimuthal rotation over a depth of ﬁeld of several micrometers, yielding independent measurements of the eﬀective hydrodynamic radius that agree to within 0.2\%. The internal and external consistency of these measurements validate the technique. Because the discrete dipole approximation can model scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles, our technique could be used in a range of applications, including particle tracking, microrheology, and fundamental studies of colloidal self-assembly or microbial motion.},

We observe anisotropic rotational and translational diffusion arising from the asymmetries of the clusters. In the case of the three-particle triangular cluster, we also detect a small but statistically significant difference in the rotational diffusion about the two in-plane axes. We attribute this difference to weak breaking of threefold rotational symmetry due to a small amount of particle polydispersity. Our experimental measurements agree well with numerical calculations and show how diffusion constants can be measured under conditions relevant to colloidal self-assembly, where theoretical and even numerical prediction is difficult.},

	abstract = {The energetics and assembly pathways of small clusters may yield insights into processes occurring at the earliest stages of nucleation. We use a model system consisting of micrometer-sized, spherical colloidal particles to study the structure and dynamics of small clusters, where the number of particles is small (N ≤ 10). The particles interact through a short-range depletion attraction with a depth of a few {kBT}. We describe two methods to form colloidal clusters, one based on isolating the particles in microwells and another based on directly assembling clusters in the gas phase using optical tweezers. We use the first technique to obtain ensemble-averaged probabilities of cluster structures as a function of N. These experiments show that clusters with symmetries compatible with crystalline order are rarely formed under equilibrium conditions. We use the second technique to study the dynamics of the clusters, and in particular how they transition between free-energy minima. To monitor the clusters we use a fast three-dimensional imaging technique, digital holographic microscopy, that can resolve the positions of each particle in the cluster with 30–45 nm precision on millisecond timescales. The real-space measurements allow us to obtain estimates for the lifetimes of the energy minima and the transition states. It is not yet clear whether the observed dynamics are relevant for small nuclei, which may not have sufficient time to transition between states before other particles or clusters attach to them. However, the measurements do provide some glimpses into how systems containing a small number of particles traverse their free-energy landscape.},

In this work, we compare the performance of two complementary analysis techniques, one based on fitting to the exact Lorenz-Mie theory and the other based on phenomenological interpretation of the scattered light field reconstructed with Rayleigh-Sommerfeld back-propagation. Although Lorenz-Mie tracking provides more information and is inherently more precise, Rayleigh-Sommerfeld reconstruction is faster and more general. The two techniques agree quantitatively on colloidal spheres’ in-plane positions. Their systematic differences in axial tracking can be explained in terms of the illuminated objects’ light scattering properties.},

Conventionally approached with heuristic algorithms, this image analysis problem can be solved faster and more generally with machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate that two popular machine-learning algorithms, cascade classifiers and deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}), can solve the feature-localization problem orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our {CNN} implementation localizes holographic features precisely enough to bootstrap more detailed analyses based on the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering. The wavelet-based Haar cascade proves to be less precise, but is so computationally efficient that it creates new opportunities for applications that emphasize speed and low cost.

Analyzing one colloidal particle’s hologram with the Lorenz–Mie theory of light scattering yields the particle’s three-dimensional position with nanometer precision while simultaneously reporting its size and refractive index with part-per-thousand resolution. Analyzing a few thousand holograms in this way provides a comprehensive picture of the particles that make up a dispersion, even for complex multicomponent systems. All of this valuable information comes at the cost of three computationally expensive steps: (1) identifying and localizing features of interest within recorded holograms, (2) estimating each particle’s properties based on characteristics of the associated features, and finally (3) optimizing those estimates through pixel-by-pixel fits to a generative model. Here, we demonstrate an end-to-end implementation that is based entirely on machine-learning techniques. Characterizing and Tracking Colloids Holographically ({CATCH}) with deep convolutional neural networks is fast enough for real-time applications and otherwise outperforms conventional analytical algorithms, particularly for heterogeneous and crowded samples. We demonstrate this system’s capabilities with experiments on free-flowing and holographically trapped colloidal spheres.},

The author also explains how the scattering functions for a homogenous sphere change depending on different physical parameters such as the optical size, the complex refractive index, and the angle of observation. The author addresses the assignment of a complex dielectric constant and a corresponding refractive index to plasma when an alternating electrical field is applied that will make the plasma exhibit conductivity and polarization. In a liquid, the author points out that the intensity of scattering is one or two orders of magnitude less than that found in a gaseous system; he explains that the molecules are no longer acting as incoherent nor as randomly located scatterers.

	abstract = {We investigate several approximate methods of finding the double-layer interaction free energy, according to the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, of two charged spheres with centers at distance R apart in electrolyte solution. The spheres may have unequal radii a1 and a2 and unequal surface potentials. An appropriate approximation at reasonably large values of κ(R − a1 − a2), where κ is the Debye-Huckel constant, is that of linear superposition (L.S.A.). The potential in the neighborhood of the plane equidistant from the two centers is equated to ψ1(r1) + ψ2(r2), where r1 and r2 are distances from the centers and ψ1 and ψ2 are the potentials due to the two spheres considered as isolated systems. By using the theoretical work of Gronwall, La Mer, and Sandved or the numerical results of Loeb, Wiersema, and Overbeek for single sphere potential distributions, the method can be applied to higher surface potentials, outside the linear Debye-Hu¨ckel range. A simple general form of the interaction energy at large separations suitable for all radii and potentials is obtained. An integral equation method, recently developed to solve the Debye-Hu¨ckel equation for two identical, charged particles, is extended to the case of two particles having both unequal radii (a1, a2) and unequal potentials. This is applicable when κa1 and κa2 ≥ 5 and surface potentials are small. It gives the correct limiting form at large separations and also reduces to a formula which is derived from the method of Derjaguin at small separations. An extension to larger potentials is suggested. We also examine the conditions under which two spherical particles, having equal radii but unequal surface potentials of the same sign, show electric double-layer attraction in the Debye-Hu¨ckel range. Numerical values of interaction free energy and force are compared with those directly computed for pairs of spheres of equal radius a and equal potential. The proposed extension to larger potentials of the interaction formula by the integral equation method gives overall satisfactory agreement with available numerical results for κa ∼ 5. As an alternative, it is possible to combine the L.S.A. at large separations with the Derjaguin formula at small separations and so obtain good values for both force and interaction energy at all separations and potentials.},

It is unnecessary here to enumerate the different methods which have been employed, and the several corrections which must be made, in order to deduce from the actual observations the result which would correspond to the ideal case of a simple pendulum performing indefinitely small oscillations in vacuum. There is only one of these corrections which bears on the subject of the present paper, namely, the correction usually termed the {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}reduction to a vacuum{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. On account of the inconvenience and expense attending experiments in a vacuum apparatus, the observations are usually made in air, and it then becomes necessary to apply a small correction, in order to reduce the observed result to what would have been observed had the pendulum been swung in a vacuum. The most obvious effect of the air consists in a diminution of the moving force, and consequent increase in the time of vibration, arising from the buoyancy of the fluid. The correction for buoyancy is easily calculated from the first principles of hydrostatics, and formed for a considerable time the only correction which it was thought necessary to make for reduction to a vacuum.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

For the interaction of flat plates, a single expression is shown to be an adequate substitute for two empirical formulae of Overbeek. This expression is then used to derive a simple result for retarded interaction between unequal spheres at close approach which agrees fairly well with “exact” computations up to separations of about 10\% of the sphere radius. An equivalent expression applies to the sphere-plate system but in this case an even simpler result is shown to give reasonable agreement with exact computations up to distances of about 20\% of the sphere radius. These approximations take the form of simple unretarded Hamaker formulae, together with a correction factor which depends on the separation distance and the characteristic wavelength of the dispersion interaction. They should find application in problems of colloid stability and particle deposition.},

	abstract = {Asymptotic solutions of the Stokes equations are derived for both the translational and rotational motions of a sphere parallel to a plane wall bounding a semi-infinite, quiescent, viscous fluid in the limit where the gap width tends to zero. In a numerical sense these solutions are shown to agree asymptotically with the ‘exact’ bipolar co-ordinate solutions of O'Neill [1] and Dean and O'Neill [2] after correcting the numerical computations of the latter. The results are applied to the motion of a sphere ‘rolling’ down an inclined plane under the influence of gravity. It is demonstrated that the sphere cannot be in physical contact with the wall, and that it ‘slips’ as it rolls down the wall. Failure of the theory to agree with the experimental data of Carty [3] is tentatively attributed to cavitation.
Résumé
Les solutions asymptotiques des équations de Stokes sont dérivées à la fois pour les mouvements de translation et de rotation d'une sphère parallèle à la paroi plane délimitant un fluide visqueux, semi-infini, au repos, dans la limite où la largeur de l'interstice tend vers zéro. On démontre que, d'un point de vue numérique, des solutions s'accordent asymptotiquement avec les solutions ‘exactes’ de co-ordonnées bipolaires de O'Neill [1] et de Dean et O'Neill [2], rectification faite des calculs numériques de ces dernières. Les résultats sont appliqués au mouvement d'une sphère ‘roulant’ vers le bas d'une inclinaison plane sous l'influence de la gravité. Il est démontré que la sphère ne peut pas être physiquement en contact avec la paroi, et qu'elle ‘dérape’ à mesure qu'elle roule vers le bas de la paroi. On est tenté d'attribuer à la cavitation l'échec de l'accord de cette théorie avec les données expérimentales de Carty [3].
Zusammenfassung
Asymptotische Lösungen der Stokes Gleichungen werden sowohl für die Translations als auch für die Rotationsbewegungen einer Kugel parallel zu einer ebenen Wand, die an einer halb unbegrenzten, ruhenden zähen Flüssigkeit angrenzt, in dem Bereiche, in dem sich die Abstandsweite der Grenze Null nähert, abgeleitet. Im numerischen Sinn erweist es sich, dass diese Lösungen asymptotisch mit den “präzisen” bipolaren, koordinierten Lösungen von O'Neill [1] und Dean und O'Neill [2] übereinstimmen, nachdem sie zahlenmässigen Berechnungen der letzteren berichtigt wurden. Die Resultate werden auf die Bewegung einer Kugel, die infolge ihrer Schwerkraft an einer schrägen Ebene herunterrollt, bezogen. Es wird bewiesen, dass die Kugel mit der Wand nicht in physischem Kontakt sein kann, und dass sie, indem sie von der Wand herabrollt, “rutscht”. Die Tatsache, dass diese Theorie mit den Versuchsergebnissen von Carty [3] nicht übereinstimmt, wird vorläufig der Kavitation zugeschrieben.},

In addition to standard subjects, the reader will find a detailed account of broken symmetries, critical phenomena and the renormalization group, as well as an introduction to numerical methods. The second half of the book is devoted to nonequilibrium phenomena, first following a macroscopic approach, with hydrodynamics as an important example. Kinetic theory receives a thorough treatment through analysis of the Boltzmann-Lorentz model and the Boltzmann equation. The book concludes with general nonequilibrium methods such as linear response, projection method and the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, including numerical simulations.

Because the information on the third dimension is encoded in the tracer intensity, variation in the tracer size, which is proportional to the particle intensity, can lead to signiﬁcant measurement uncertainty. In this work, we consider the measurement bias introduced by tracer size polydispersity on the ﬂuid velocimetry measurements. We present a general theoretical model to account for tracer size variation, interaction potentials between tracers and the solid substrate (e.g. electrostatic, van der Waals forces), and analysis of image data. Computational results are provided for typical experimental conditions, and the implications for nano-velocimetry accuracy are discussed. We ﬁnd that increased tracer particle size variation and the detectability limit of tracer intensity increase measurement bias by up to 10\%, which should be accounted for in experimental measurements.},

We present an approach to extract local biophysical properties of cell-particle interaction from such newly acquired large collection of data. Because classical methods do not keep the spatial localization of individual trajectories, it is not possible to access localized biophysical parameters. In contrast, by combining the high-density superresolution imaging data with the present analysis, we determine the local properties of protein dynamics. We specifically focus on {AMPA} receptor ({AMPAR}) trafficking and estimate the strength of their molecular interaction at the subdiffraction level in hippocampal dendrites. These interactions correspond to attracting potential wells of large size, showing that the high density of {AMPARs} is generated by physical interactions with an ensemble of cooperative membrane surface binding sites, rather than molecular crowding or aggregation, which is the case for the membrane viral glycoprotein {VSVG}. We further show that {AMPARs} can either be pushed in or out of dendritic spines. Finally, we characterize the recurrent step of influenza trajectories. To conclude, the present analysis allows the identification of the molecular organization responsible for the heterogeneities of random trajectories in cells.},

	abstract = {The complex refractive indices of polymers have important applications in the analysis of their components and the study of radiation endothermic mechanisms. Since these materials have high transmittance in the visible to near-infrared ranges, it is difficult to accurately measure their complex refractive indices. At present, the data for complex refractive indices of polymers are seriously lacking, which greatly limits the applications of these materials in the field of thermal radiation. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry ({SE}) combined with the ray tracing method ({RTM}) is used to measure the complex refractive indices of five polymers, polydimethylsiloxane, poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}), polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate, in the spectral range of 0.4–2 µm. The double optical pathlength transmission method ({DOPTM}) is used to measure the complex refractive indices of three polymers, {PMMA}, polyvinyl chloride, and polyetherimide, in the 0.4–2 µm range. The complex refractive index of {PMMA} measured by the {DOPTM} almost coincides with the data measured by {SE} combined with the {RTM}. The results show that the trends of the complex refractive indices spectra for the seven polymers in the 0.4–2 µm range are similar. This work makes up for the lack of complex refractive indices in the 0.4–2 µm range for these seven materials and points out the direction for accurate measurements of the complex refractive indices of polymers with weak absorption.},

	title = {Analysis of photonic structures for silicon solar cells},
	abstract = {Integrating photonic structures into the surface is an established procedure to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells. This is achieved by increasing the light absorption through reduced surface reflectance or longer light path lengths. The fabrication of random pyramids on monocrystalline and the isotexture on multicrystalline silicon via maskless wet chemical etching is a standard process in the photovoltaic industry. Alternative structure types aim at an absorptance enhancement compared to this
state of the art, which finally increases the energy conversion efficiency of the device.
The analysis within this work covers (i) the development of an efficient simulation formalism for determining the optical properties of silicon solar cells with one or more structured interfaces that can operate in different optical regimes; (ii) the comparison of a large variety of photonic structures and structure combinations with regard to benefits for the solar cell optics; (iii) a further development of the structure fabrication based on nanoimprint lithography and etching focusing on the up-scaling capabilities via an increased stamp lifetime and (iv) the demonstration of an efficiency enhancement on solar cell and mini-module level via integration of exemplary photonic structures.
After ensuring a good agreement between the developed {OPTOS} simulation formalism and established modeling techniques as well as reference measurements, various photonic structures are evaluated. Diffractive rear side gratings are demonstrated to enhance the light trapping properties of 150 μm thick solar cells with planar as well as textured front side, reaching photocurrent gains of up to 3.5 {mA}/cm2. The experimental realization of this structure in an electrically planar but optically structured rear interface led to an absolute efficiency increase of 1.1 \% and proved the potential of this concept for the first time on solar cell level. The honeycomb texture is found to be clearly superior to the isotexture on multicrystalline silicon substrates. The simulated photocurrent gains of 2.4 {mA}/cm2 on cell level and 1.0 {mA}/cm2 on module level are supported by characterization results of Al-{BSF} and {PERC} solar cells. Those were fabricated using industrial-like processes such as screen printing on the standard size of 156 × 156 mm2. The structuring itself profits strongly from the newly applied temperature assisted imprint process. It enabled a stamp lifetime increase to more than 100 imprints without measurable degradation, which is a crucial development for the up-scaled realization of alternative photonic structures.},

	abstract = {Le farad (symbole : F), tiré du nom du physicien Michael Faraday, est l'unité dérivée de capacité électrique du Système international ({SI}).
Un farad est la capacité d'un conducteur électrique isolé pour laquelle une addition de 6,241 × 1018 électrons provoque une augmentation de son potentiel de 1 volt (aspect électrostatique). Cette charge électrique composée de 6,241 × 1018 électrons représente en fait une charge électrique de 1 coulomb. (Le coulomb est aussi le nombre d'électrons traversant chaque seconde la section d'un conducteur parcouru par un courant de 1 ampère (aspect électrodynamique)).
Il faut considérer tout conducteur comme un « réservoir » à électrons, susceptible d'être plus ou moins rempli à l'aide d'un contact électrique avec un générateur d'électrons ou vidé avec un récepteur d'électrons. 
Cette capacité attribuée au conducteur électrique ne dépend que de la forme du conducteur. Par exemple, en considérant la Terre comme une sphère conductrice de 12 800 km de diamètre, on trouve une capacité de {\textasciitilde}710 × 10−6 farad ({\textasciitilde}710 µF).
Le composant électronique appelé « condensateur » utilise cette propriété mais en associant deux conducteurs (ou plus), chacun des conducteurs exerçant son « influence », si possible totale, sur l'autre conducteur. C'est sous cette condition d'influence électrostatique d'un conducteur sur l'autre que l'on fabrique les condensateurs utilisés en électronique.

Cette unité est en pratique très grande. On utilise usuellement ses sous-multiples, microfarad (symbole : µF), nanofarad (symbole : {nF}) et picofarad (symbole : {pF}).
Depuis quelques années, on peut trouver sur le marché des composants électroniques : des « super-condensateurs » d'une capacité variant entre un et mille farads. Ces condensateurs ont une tension de service assez faible, de l'ordre de 2,7 volts. La mise en série et parallèle de nombreux de ces « super-cap » permet d'obtenir un genre de batterie susceptible de stocker assez d'énergie pour une utilisation dans les transports (récupération de l'énergie de freinage). Cela peut être une alternative aux accumulateurs dans certaines applications.},

We consider materials that deform easily, due to either geometry (e.g., a shell) or constitutive properties (e.g., a gel or a rubber), so that the effects of pressure and temperature on the fluid properties may be neglected. Four different system geometries are considered: a rigid cylinder moving parallel to a soft layer coating a rigid substrate; a soft cylinder moving parallel to a rigid substrate; a cylindrical shell moving parallel to a rigid substrate; and finally a cylindrical conforming journal bearing coated with a thin soft layer. In addition, for the particular case of a soft layer coating a rigid substrate, we consider both elastic and poroelastic material responses. For all these cases, we find the same generic behavior: there is an optimal combination of geometric and material parameters that maximizes the dimensionless normal force as a function of the softness parameter η=hydrodynamicpressure∕elasticstiffness=surfacedeflection∕gapthickness, which characterizes the fluid-induced deformation of the interface. The corresponding cases for a spherical slider are treated using scaling concepts.},

Using a minimal but robust artificial microfluidic environment, we show that it is possible to evoke, control, and inhibit the collective vasoocclusive or jamming event in sickle cell disease. We use a combination of geometric, physical, chemical, and biological means to quantify the phase space for the onset of a jamming event, as well as its dissolution, and find that oxygen-dependent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and melting alone are sufficient to recreate jamming and rescue. We further show that a key source of the heterogeneity in occlusion arises from the slow collective jamming of a confined, flowing suspension of soft cells that change their morphology and rheology relatively quickly. Finally, we quantify and investigate the effects of small-molecule inhibitors of polymerization and therapeutic red blood cell exchange on this dynamical process. Our experimental study integrates the dynamics of collective processes associated with occlusion at the molecular, polymer, cellular, and tissue level; lays the foundation for a quantitative understanding of the rate-limiting processes; and provides a potential tool for optimizing and individualizing treatment, and identifying new therapies.},

	abstract = {We consider the motion of a fluid-immersed negatively buoyant particle in the vicinity of a thin compressible elastic wall, a situation that arises in a variety of technological and natural settings. We use scaling arguments to establish different regimes of sliding, and complement these estimates using thin-film lubrication dynamics to determine an asymptotic theory for the sedimentation, sliding and spinning motions of a cylinder. The resulting theory takes the form of three coupled nonlinear singular-differential equations. Numerical integration of the resulting equations confirms our scaling relations and further yields a range of unexpected behaviours. Despite the low-Reynolds-number feature of the flow, we demonstrate that the particle can spontaneously oscillate when sliding, can generate lift via a Magnus-like effect, can undergo a spin-induced reversal effect and also shows an unusual sedimentation singularity. Our description also allows us to address a sedimentation–sliding transition that can lead to the particle coasting over very long distances, similar to certain geophysical phenomena. Finally, we show that a small modification of our theory allows us to generalize the results to account for additional effects such as wall poroelasticity.},

	abstract = {This review is aimed at unifying our understanding of cartilage viscoelastic properties in compression, in particular the role of compression-dependent permeability in controlling interstitial fluid flow and its contribution to the observed viscoelastic effects. During the previous decade, it was shown that compression causes the permeability of cartilage to drop in a functional manner described by k = k0 exp(εM) where k0 and M were defined as intrinsic permeability parameters and ε is the dilatation of the solid matrix (ε = {trΔu}). Since permeability is inversely related to the diffusive drag coefficient of relative fluid motion with respect to the porous solid matrix, the measured load-deformation response of the tissue must therefore also depend on the non-linearly permeable nature of the tissue. We have summarized in this review our understanding of this non-linear phenomenon. This understanding of these flow-dependent viscoelastic effects are put into the historical perspective of a comprehensive literature review of earlier attempts to model the compressive viscoelastic properties of articular cartilage.},

The proposed mechanism assumes that the bulk of material rides on a thin layer of highly agitated particles at low concentration. By employing the technique of two-dimensional particle dynamic computer simulation, I demonstrate that (1) this is the state to which a granular material tends when sliding down an inclined plane and (2) it is sufficient to explain the friction reduction. Finally, I present a simple mathematical model that yields order of magnitude predictions of runout distance. The argument suggests that there may be nothing particularly special about long runout landslides (except, perhaps, in the way they are initiated) and that they behave as would be expected given the current state of knowledge of particle flows.},

Applications to statistical mechanics and critical phenomena are extensively covered, and there are newly extended sections devoted to circuit design, matrix Pade approximation, computational methods, and integral and algebraic approximants. The book is written with a smooth progression from elementary ideas to some of the frontiers of research in approximation theory.

We have evaluated this effect, improving a previous treatment by Derjaguin and Muller (7). The absolute rate of rapid coagulation has been computed numerically, with the help of the complete Hamaker equation for the van der Waals force. We have found that hydrodynamic interaction diminishes this rate by a factor of about 0.4 to 0.6, depending on the Hamaker constant. This result agrees completely with that of Spielman (8). The ratio W of the rates of rapid and slow coagulation has been calculated analytically with a simplified Hamaker equation and an approximate expression for the double-layer interaction, following, with modifications, the procedure of Reerink and Overbeek (21). The factor W has also been computed by numerical integration with the complete Hamaker equation. In either calculation the effect of hydrodynamic interaction on d(ln W) /d (ln ce) (where ce is the concentration of indifferent electrolyte) is found to be small. We conclude, in agreement with Derjaguin and Muller, that the existing discrepancy between theory and experiment with regard to d(ln W)/d (ln ce) cannot be explained by this hydrodynamic effect.},

The response is computed in the framework of linear elasticity, for planar elastic substrates in the limiting cases of thick and thin layers.

	abstract = {Modern shampoos contain ingredients that provide general cleansing function and impart the cosmetic effects such as looking good and feeling better. Most commercial shampoos for normal hair are based on anionic surfactants and composed of more than two types of surfactants. The surfactants can be divided into three classes: anionic, amphoteric and nonionic surfactants, because each class has different functions. For example, anionic surfactants such as sodium/ammonium laureth sulfates ({SLES}/{ALES}), sodium/ammonium laury sulfates ({SLS}/{ALS}) and {TEA} cocoyl glutamate have cleaning, emulsifying and foaming functions. Amphoteric surfactants such as cocamidopropyl betain ({CAPB}) are typically used for increasing the viscosity and reducing the eye and skin irritation in the presence of anionic surfactants. For these reasons, amphoteric surfactants are mainly used in mild formulations such as baby shampoos. Nonionic surfactants such as cocomonoethanol amide ({CME}), cocodiethanol amide ({CDE}) are used as a foam booster and viscosity builder in the presence of anionic surfactants. Especially, alkyl polyglucoside ({APG}) is increasingly used in shampoos and detergents due to its low toxicity, environmental compatibility and excellent physical properties. In order to increase the conditioning effect in shampoos, polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}) and the cationic water soluble polymers which have the quaternized nitrogen bonded to the backbone of the water soluble polymer are used. In addition to cleaning and conditioning agents, some valid ingredients are used. These ingredients can be a chelating agent, a {pH} adjuster, a pearling agent, inorganic salts, oils, preservatives, antidandruff agents and fragrance, etc.},

This macroscopic observation is found to be closely related to microscopic phenomena occurring at the scale of the polymer network: we show that uncrosslinked chains found in most widely used commercial silicone elastomers are responsible for this surprising behavior. A direct visualization of the uncrosslinked oligomers collected by water droplets is performed, evidencing that a capillarity-induced phase separation occurs: uncrosslinked oligomers are extracted from the silicone elastomer network by the water–glycerol mixture droplet. The sharp speed change is shown to coincide with an abrupt transition in surface tension of the droplets, when a critical surface concentration in uncrosslinked oligomer chains is reached. We infer that a droplet shifts to a second regime with a faster speed when it is completely covered with a homogeneous oil film.},

With a nanomanipulation system, an increasing lateral pushing force is applied to a polymer microsphere adhered on a silicon substrate in the ambient environment, and the rolling displacement of the particle in response to the external force is recorded. The work of adhesion for polymer microspheres to the silicon substrate is extracted from the force-displacement curves. Unlike the traditional colloid probe technique where particles are glued to the cantilever beam and the normal detachment force as a function of the out-of-plane displacement is measured, in the current work the work of adhesion is directly determined from the measured rolling resistance moment and the proposed approach requires no prior knowledge of the particle diameter. In addition to the work of adhesion for the set of microspheres, the critical angles of rolling prior to rolling are estimated. The reported results form further experimental evidence for the existence of a rolling resistance moment.},

	abstract = {The adhesion of micro- and nanoparticles to solid substrates immersed in liquids is a problem of great scientific and technological importance. However, the quantitative characterization of such nanoscale adhesive contacts without rupturing them still presents a major experimental challenge. In this article, we introduce mechanical contact spectroscopy ({MCS}), an experimental technique for the nondestructive probing of particle adhesion in liquid environments. With {MCS}, the strength of adhesive contacts is inferred from residual position fluctuations of adherent particles excited by thermal forces. In particular, the strength of adhesion is correlated with the standard deviation of the particle lateral position x, with smaller position standard deviations [Formula: see text] indicating higher adhesive strength. For a given combination of particles, substrate, and immersion medium, the adhesion is characterized by the mechanical contact spectrum, which is a histogram of ξ values obtained from tracking an ensemble of adherent particles. Because the energy of thermal excitation at room temperature is very small in comparison to the typical total energy of adhesive contacts, the studied contacts remain in equilibrium during the measurement. Using {MCS}, we study the adhesion of micrometer-sized particles to planar solid substrates under a wide range of environmental conditions, including liquid immersion media of varying ionic strength and adhesion substrates with different chemical functionality of their surfaces. These experiments provide evidence that {MCS} is capable of reproducibly detecting minute changes in the particle-substrate work of adhesion while at the same time covering the range of adhesive contact strength relevant in the context of surface chemistry, biology, and microfabrication.},

	abstract = {The creeping flow around a sphere close to a wall is calculated by revisiting the bipolar coordinates solution technique. The coefficients in the expansions of the spherical harmonics are easily calculated from two recurrence relationships, following the idea of O'Neill and Bhatt (1991). That is, there is no need to solve successively larger truncated linear systems to obtain the coefficients, as was done in earlier papers for a sphere translating along a wall by (O'Neill 1964, 1967) or rotating by (Dean and O'Neill 1963) and for a shear flow around a fixed sphere by (Tözeren and Skalak 1977). Consequently, results can be obtained even for small gaps between the sphere and the wall without excessive computer resources. Thus, the present technique provides a reference to obtain all the friction coefficients and flow fields with excellent precision. Results for the friction coefficients are given with up to 17 significant digits for later reference. Earlier results for the drag force and torque coefficients by (Goldman, Cox and Brenner 1967) are recovered and in some cases corrected. The exact solutions for sphere translation and rotation are further exploited to provide approximate formulae with a precision of 10−9, based on expansions for large and small gaps. For the shear flow problem, there is no singularity near contact and a polynomial interpolation gives a precision of 10−11. The exact solutions for a shear flow around a fixed sphere and the flows due to a translating sphere and a rotating sphere in a fluid at rest are then exploited to provide approximation formulae with a precision of 10−11 for the translation and rotation velocities of a neutrally buoyant sphere freely moving along a wall in a shear flow.},

	abstract = {The basic formulas of generalized Lorenz–Mie theory are presented, and are applied to scattering of a focused Gaussian laser beam by a spherical particle. Various applications of focused beam scattering are also described, such as optimizing the rate at which morphology-dependent resonances are excited, laser trapping, particle manipulation, and the analysis of optical particle sizing instruments. Each of these applications requires either special positioning the beam with respect to the particle or illumination of only part of the particle by the beam.},

	abstract = {There has been recently a growing interest in the development of what is usually known as the T-matrix method (better to be named: T-matrix formulation), in connection with studies concerning light scattering by nonspherical particles. Another line of research has been devoted to the development of generalized Lorenz–Mie theories dealing with the interaction between arbitrary electromagnetic shaped beams and some regular particles, allowing one to solve Maxwell’s equations by using a method of separation of variables. Both lines of research are conjointly considered in this paper. Results of generalized Lorenz–Mie theories in spherical coordinates (for homogeneous spheres, multilayered spheres, spheres with an eccentrically located spherical inclusion, assemblies of spheres and aggregates) are modified from scalar results in the framework of the Bromwich method to vectorial expressions using vector spherical wave functions ({VSWFs}) in order to match the T-matrix formulation, and to express the T-matrix. The results obtained are used as a basis to clarify statements, some of them erroneous, concerning the T-matrix formulation and to provide recommendations for better terminologies.},
