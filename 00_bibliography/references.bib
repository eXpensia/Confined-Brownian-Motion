	abstract = {Given a theoretical model for a self-propelled particle or micro-organism, how does one optimally determine the parameters of the model from experimental data in the form of a time-lapse recorded trajectory? For very long trajectories, one has very good statistics, and optimality may matter little. However, for biological micro-organisms, one may not control the duration of recordings, and then optimality can matter. This is especially the case if one is interested in individuality and hence cannot improve statistics by taking population averages over many trajectories. One can learn much about this problem by studying its simplest case, pure diﬀusion with no self-propagation. This is an interesting problem also in its own right for the very same reasons: interest in individuality and short trajectories. We summarize our recent results on this latter issue here and speculate about the extent to which similar results may be obtained also for self-propelled particles.},

U.S.A. 106, 15160 (2009)] have found that in several systems the linear time dependence of the mean-square displacement ({MSD}) of diffusing colloidal particles, typical of normal diffusion, is accompanied by a non-Gaussian displacement distribution G(x,t), with roughly exponential tails at short times, a situation they termed “anomalous yet Brownian” diffusion. The diversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We present such a model where there is diffusivity memory but no direction memory in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear {MSD} and a non-Gaussian G(x,t) at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is undergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression “diffusing diffusivity”. G(x,t) is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if the distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential remains a good fit for a variety of diffusivity distributions. Moreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.},

	abstract = {Background
Experimental results are commonly fitted by determining parameter values of suitable mathematical expressions. In case a relation exists between different data sets, the accuracy of the parameters obtained can be increased by incorporating this relationship in the fitting process instead of fitting the recordings separately.

Methods
An algorithm to fit multiple measured curves simultaneously was developed. The method accounts for parameters that are shared by some curves. It can be applied to either linear or nonlinear equations. Simulated noisy "measurement results" were created to compare the introduced method to the "straight forward" way of fitting the curves separately.

Results
The analysis of the simulated measurements confirm, that the introduced method yields more accurate parameters compared to the ones gained by fitting the measurements separately. Therefore it needs more computer time. As an example, the new fitting algorithm is applied to the measurements of the evoked compound action potentials ({ECAP}) of the auditory nerve: This leads to promising ideas to reduce artefacts generated by the measuring process.

Conclusion
The introduced fitting algorithm uses the relationship between multiple measurement results to increase the accuracy of the parameters. Its application in the field of {ECAP} measurements is promising and should be further investigated.},

	abstract = {We study the motion of a spherical particle driven by a constant volume force in a confined channel with a fixed square cross-section. The channel is filled with a mixture of two liquids under the effect of thermal fluctuations. We use the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate a fluctuating multicomponent fluid in the mixed-phase, and particle-fluid interactions are tuned to reproduce different wetting properties at the particle surface. The numerical set-up is first validated in the absence of thermal fluctuations; to this aim, we quantitatively compute the drift velocity at changing the particle radius and compare it with previous experimental and numerical data. In the presence of thermal fluctuations, we study the fluctuations in the particle's velocity at changing thermal energy, applied force, particle size, and particle wettability. The importance of fluctuations with respect to the mean drift velocity is quantitatively assessed, especially in comparison to unconfined situations. Results show that confinement strongly enhances the importance of velocity fluctuations, which can be one order of magnitude larger than what expected in unconfined domains. The observed findings underscore the versatility of the lattice Boltzmann simulations in concrete applications involving the motion of colloidal particles in a highly confined environment in the presence of thermal fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Strongly adsorbed polyelectrolytes are central in the conditioning properties of many personal care products. Whereas the mechanism of polymer adsorption is rather well understood, less is known about the actual mechanism of polyelectrolyte lubrication. We investigated the adsorption on mica and the lubricant properties of a strong polyelectrolyte, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), {polyDADMAC}, in aqueous solutions of diﬀerent salt concentrations. We found that the adsorption of the polymer was enhanced and the morphology of the adsorbed layer modiﬁed by increasing salt concentration. The lubricant properties of the adsorbed polyelectrolyte layer were good at low compressions but rapidly deteriorated at larger applied pressure. A complex velocity dependence of the friction was observed, with a maximum value at intermediate velocities and hysteresis in an acceleration/ deceleration cycle. A progressive increase in separation between the rubbing surfaces with velocity was also observed. We developed a model that describes the complex behavior of friction observed, taking into account the hysteretic elastic deformation of the polymer layer under shear and the dilatency due to the elastohydrodynamic eﬀects resulting from its low elastic modulus. Our results can help to explain the signiﬁcant lasting of the lubricating properties when {polyDADMAC} is used in conditioners, where polymer-lubricated hair-hair contacts exhibit low shear forces.},

We present a simple model based on a discrete approach that predicts the nature of these patterns and their non-trivial scheme of arrangement in a sequence as a function of the ratio of the two timescales of the problem, the production times of droplets and drops.

Here, by coupling microfluidic experiments, theory, and numerics, we succeed in unravelling the problem for the case of straight channels at high salinity. We discover a broad regime of deposition (the van der Waals regime) in which particle–wall van der Waals interactions govern the deposition mechanism. We determine the range of existence of the regime, for which we calculate the concentration profiles, retention profiles, and deposition kinetics analytically. The retention profiles decay as the inverse of the square root of the distance from the entry, and the deposition kinetics are given by the expression S≈(A2.1kT{ξL})1/2, where S is a dimensionless deposition function, A is the Hamaker constant, and ξL is a dimensionless parameter characterizing fluid flow properties. These findings are well supported by numerics. Experimentally, we find that the retention profiles behave as x–0.5±0.1 (where x is the distance from the channel entry) over three decades in scale, as predicted theoretically. By varying the flow conditions (speed, geometry, surface properties, and concentration) so as to cover four decades in ξL and taking the Hamaker constant as a free parameter, we accurately confirm the theoretical expression for the deposition kinetics. Operating in the van der Waals regime enables control of the deposition rates via surface chemistry. From a surface science perspective, working in the van der Waals regime enables us to measure the Hamaker constants of thousands of particles in a few minutes, a task that would take a much longer time to perform with standard {AFM}.},

Our results are applicable to a wide range of physical problems, from a protein diffusing in a membrane to the dispersion of a passive tracer in a random potential. In the case of passive diffusion in a scalar field, we show that the coupling to the field can, in some cases, speed up the diffusion corresponding to a form of stochastic resonance.

	abstract = {Metastasis requires the penetration of cancer cells through tight spaces, which is mediated by the physical properties of the cells as well as their interactions with the confined environment. Various microfluidic approaches have been devised to mimic traversal in vitro by measuring the time required for cells to pass through a constriction. Although a cell’s passage time is expected to depend on its deformability, measurements from existing approaches are confounded by a cell's size and its frictional properties with the channel wall. Here, we introduce a device that enables the precise measurement of (i) the size of a single cell, given by its buoyant mass, (ii) the velocity of the cell entering a constricted microchannel (entry velocity), and (iii) the velocity of the cell as it transits through the constriction (transit velocity). Changing the deformability of the cell by perturbing its cytoskeleton primarily alters the entry velocity, whereas changing the surface friction by immobilizing positive charges on the constriction's walls primarily alters the transit velocity, indicating that these parameters can give insight into the factors affecting the passage of each cell. When accounting for cell buoyant mass, we find that cells possessing higher metastatic potential exhibit faster entry velocities than cells with lower metastatic potential. We additionally find that some cell types with higher metastatic potential exhibit greater than expected changes in transit velocities, suggesting that not only the increased deformability but reduced friction may be a factor in enabling invasive cancer cells to efficiently squeeze through tight spaces.},

In this chapter, we review the Brownian motion of a particle moving in the vicinity of a living cell whose membrane is endowed with a resistance towards shear and bending. The analytical calculations proceed through the computation of the frequency-dependent mobility functions and the application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Elastic interfaces endow the system with memory effects that lead to a long-lived anomalous subdiffusive regime of nearby particles. In the steady limit, the diffusional behavior approaches that near a no-slip hard wall. The analytical predictions are validated and supplemented with boundary-integral simulations.},

	abstract = {Recent molecular dynamics simulations of glass-forming liquids revealed superdiffusive fluctuations associated with the position of a tracer particle ({TP}) driven by an external force. Such an anomalous response, whose mechanism remains elusive, has been observed up to now only in systems close to their glass transition, suggesting that this could be one of its hallmarks. Here, we show that the presence of superdiffusion is in actual fact much more general, provided that the system is crowded and geometrically confined. We present and solve analytically a minimal model consisting of a driven {TP} in a dense, crowded medium in which the motion of particles is mediated by the diffusion of packing defects, called vacancies. For such nonglass-forming systems, our analysis predicts a long-lived superdiffusion which ultimately crosses over to giant diffusive behavior. We find that this trait is present in confined geometries, for example long capillaries and stripes, and emerges as a universal response of crowded environments to an external force. These findings are confirmed by numerical simulations of systems as varied as lattice gases, dense liquids, and granular fluids.},

We explore this in a minimal setting by considering a fluid-immersed negatively buoyant cylinder moving along a soft inclined wall. Our experiments show that there is an emergent robust steady-state sliding regime of the cylinder with an effective friction that is significantly reduced relative to that of rigid fluid-lubricated contacts. A simple scaling approach that couples the cylinder-induced flow to substrate deformation allows us to explain the elastohydrodynamic lift that underlies the self-sustained lubricated motion of the cylinder, consistent with recent theoretical predictions. Our results suggest an explanation for a range of effects such as reduced wear in animal joints and long-runout landslides, and can be couched as a design principle for low-friction interfaces.},

	abstract = {It is known that an object translating parallel to a soft wall in a viscous fluid produces hydrodynamic stresses that deform the wall, which in turn results in a lift force on the object. Recent experiments with cylinders sliding under gravity near a soft incline, which confirmed theoretical arguments for the lift force, also reported an unexplained steady-state rotation of the cylinders [B. Saintyves et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA} 113, 5847 (2016)]. Motivated by these observations, we show, in the lubrication limit, that an infinite cylinder that translates in a viscous fluid parallel to a soft wall at constant speed and separation distance must also rotate in order to remain free of torque. Using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we show analytically that for small deformations of the elastic layer, the angular velocity of the cylinder scales with the cube of the sliding speed. These predictions are confirmed numerically. We then apply the theory to the gravity-driven motion of a cylinder near a soft incline and find qualitative agreement with the experimental observations, namely, that a softer elastic layer results in a greater angular speed of the cylinder.},

	abstract = {An optical technique for measuring the thickness of thin films has been adapted and evaluated for studying the structure of the adhesion of cells to glass in tissue culture. This technique, which is termed interference reflection microscopy, has been used to study embryonic chick heart fibroblasts. These findings have been observed: in normal culture medium the closest approach of the cell surface to substrate in its adhesions is ca. 100 A, much of the cell surface lying farther away; chemical treatments which bring the cell surface to near its charge reversal point reduce the closest approach of adhesions to {\textless}50 A, probably to {\textless}30 A; chemical treatments which increase surface charge increase the nearest approach of cell and substrate in adhesions from ca. 100 A; high osmotic concentration of a non-polar substance, i.e. sucrose, does not affect the distance between cell and substrate in the adhesions. In addition, optical evidence indicates that there is no extracellular material between cell and glass in the adhesions. When cells de-adhere from glass, they appear not to leave fragments behind. The adhesive sites in these fibroblasts appear to be confined to the edge of the side of the cell facing the substrate and to the pseudopods. The significance of this is discussed in relation to the phenomenon of contact inhibition. Evidence is presented that the mechanism of cell adhesion does not involve calcium atoms binding cells to substrate by combining with carboxyl groups on cell surface, substrate, and with a cement substance. Osmium tetroxide fixation results in a final separation of 100 to 200 A between cell and substrate: there are reasons for thinking that this fairly close approach to the condition in life is produced as an artefact. The results can be accounted for only in terms of the action of electrostatic repulsive forces and an attractive force, probably the van der Waals-London forces. Biological arguments suggest that these results are equally applicable for cell-to-cell adhesions.},

Unambiguous quantitative measurements have been achieved for colloidal beads and model membranes, thus revealing new insights and applications. Quantification of data from cells shows exciting prospects. Herein, we review the basic principles and recent developments of {RICM} applied to studies of dynamical adhesion processes in soft matter and cell biology and provide practical hints to potential users.},

	abstract = {This chapter describes reflection interference contrast microscopy ({RICM}). The term “{RICM}” is used in the chapter to cover all optical configurations and practical applications of the method. The method by which the light reflected from a semitransparent, epi-illuminated specimen contributes to the image formation in a microscope has been given different names, depending on details of the optical configuration of the microscope and on the particular application. It was introduced into cell biology by Curtis using the name “interference reflection microscopy” ({IRM}), and this name, or its variant, “reflection interference microscopy” ({RIM}), is often used in studies of adhesion of living cells. Ploem used the term “reflection contrast microscopy” ({RCM}) on the introduction of the antiflex method to increase image contrast. In {RICM} of living cells, reflections from the cell plasma membrane and intracellular membranes contribute to the image formation by interfering with each other and with the light reflected from the interface between the underlying glass surface and the liquid medium.},

	abstract = {Even though scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) is now needed to identify some species of diatoms, the majority of identifications and quantification of these organisms in ecological works is accomplished with a light microscope, using transmitted light optical methods. In this paper we demonstrate the use of interference reflection contrast (incident light) for the examination of diatoms, a method that significantly improves the resolution of structural detail, and therefore, identification of diatom taxa with light microscopy. Using incident light we were routinely able to distinguish between structures that were close to the theoretical limit of resolution for visible light, and that were not resolvable with such standard transmitted light techniques as phase contrast and differential interference contrast ({DIC}). Light microscopes with epi-illumination light paths can be easily and inexpensively outfitted to use this simple technique.

	abstract = {Reflection contrast microscopy ({RCM}), which utilizes the optical phenomena caused by oblique epi-illumination in combination with a specific optical apparatus, provides an approach for exploring biological phenomena in greater detail. The lack of stray reflection makes it superior to other microscopes. It bridges light and electron microscopic capabilities by allowing the analysis of ultrathin sections beyond the usual light microscopic magnification. By using consecutive image analysis, quantitation can be achieved. The wide range of applications of {RCM} can be combined with most microscopical techniques, so extending the spectrum of information that can be gathered. Twenty-five years after the development of {RCM}, there is still scope for its application in modern cell biology.},

	abstract = {We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, {GW}151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ({LIGO}) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 {UTC}. The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered {GW}151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5σ. The signal persisted in the {LIGO} frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of 3.4+0.7−0.9×10−22. The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are 14.2+8.3−3.7M⊙ and 7.5+2.3−2.3M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 20.8+6.1−1.7M⊙. We find that at least one of the component black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity distance of 440+180−190 Mpc corresponding to a redshift of 0.09+0.03−0.04. All uncertainties define a 90\% credible interval. This second gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar populations and on deviations from general relativity.},

The outstanding force resolution level is provided by the large size of the statistical ensemble built by recording all displacements from all diffusing particles, regardless of trajectory and time. This is only possible because the noise driving the particles is thermal, white and stationary, so that the colloidal system is ergodic, as we carefully verify. Using an ergodic colloidal dispersion for performing ultra-sensitive measurements of external forces is not limited to non-conservative optical force fields. Our experiments therefore give way to interesting opportunities in the context of weak force measurements in fluids.},

The measured mean square displacements ({MSDs}) in the lateral x-y directions show good agreement with the theory for all tested nanoparticles of radii 50, 100, 250, and 500 nm. However, the measured {MSDs} in the z direction deviate substantially from the theory particularly for the case of smaller particles of 50 and 100 nm radius. Since the theory considers only the hydrodynamic interaction of moving particles with a stationary solid wall, additionally possible interaction forces like gravitational forces, van der Waals forces, and electro-osmotic forces have been examined to delineate the physical reasons for the discrepancy.},

	abstract = {During the last 10 years, we have developed a new experimental technique called Total Internal Reflection Microscopy. Using {TIRM} we can monitor the separation distance between a single microscopic sphere immersed in an aqueous solution and a transparent plate. Because the distance is calculated from the intensity of light scattered by the sphere (3–30 μm in diameter) when illuminated by an evanescent wave, this technique provides a sensitive, non-intrusive, and instantaneous measure of the distance between the sphere and the plate. Changes in distance as small as 1 nm can be detected. From the equilibrium distribution of separation distances sampled by Brownian motion, we determine the potential energy profile in the vicinity of the minimum formed by gravitational attraction and double-layer repulsion or steric repulsion caused by an adsorbed soluble polymer. Forces as small as 0.01 {pN} can be detected. We have also measured van der Waals attraction, the radiation pressure exerted by a focused laser beam, receptor-mediated interaction between antigen and antibodies, and steric repulsion due to adsorbed polymer layers. From the autocorrelation of the temporal fluctuations in scattering intensity, we have inferred the value of the normal component of the diffusion coefficient, which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk value owing to the close proximity of the sphere to the wall. This provides the first experimental test of Einstein’s equation (relating mobility and diffusion coefficient) in a colloidal force field.},

Exploring the “zero shear rate” limit, it rules out shear rate threshold to slip effects and extends the range over which slip lengths are shown to be flow independent. Avoiding the nucleation of gas pockets (nanobubbles) through external forcing, it validates the theoretical picture for intrinsic liquid-solid interfaces, reporting nanometric slip lengths (b=18±5 nmb=18±5 nm) only in nonwetting situations, opening the route to quantitative study on more complex surfaces with combined effects of nonwettability and roughness.},

	abstract = {Scientists today have completely different ideas of what machines can learn to do than we had only 10 y ago.

In image processing, speech and video processing, machine vision, natural language processing, and classic two-player games, in particular, the state-of-the-art has been rapidly pushed forward over the last decade, as a series of machine-learning performance records were achieved for publicly organized challenge problems. In many of these challenges, the records now meet or exceed human performance level.

A contest in 2010 proved that the Go-playing computer software of the day could not beat a strong human Go player. Today, in 2020, no one believes that human Go players—including human world champion Lee Sedol—can beat {AlphaGo}, a system constructed over the last decade. These new performance records, and the way they were achieved, obliterate the expectations of 10 y ago. At that time, human-level performance seemed a long way off and, for many, it seemed that no technologies then available would be able to deliver such performance.

Systems like {AlphaGo} benefited in this last decade from a completely unanticipated simultaneous expansion on several fronts. On the one hand, we saw the unprecedented availability of on-demand scalable computing power in the form of cloud computing, and on the other hand, a massive industrial investment in assembling human engineering teams from a globalized talent pool by some of the largest global technology players. These resources were steadily deployed over that decade to allow rapid expansions in challenge problem performance.

The 2010s produced a true technology explosion, a one-time–only transition: The sudden public availability of massive image and text data. Billions of people posted trillions of images and documents on social media, as the phrase “Big Data” entered media awareness. Image processing and natural language processing were forever changed by this new data resource …

	abstract = {Interest in Brownian motion was shared by different communities: this phenomenon was first observed by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827, then theorised by physicists in the 1900s, and eventually modelled by mathematicians from the 1920s, while still evolving as a physical theory. Consequently, Brownian motion now refers to the natural phenomenon but also to the theories accounting for it. There is no published work telling its entire history from its discovery until today, but rather partial histories either from 1827 to Perrin’s experiments in the late 1900s, from a physicist’s point of view; or from the 1920s from a mathematician’s point of view. In this article, we tackle the period straddling the two ‘half-histories’ just mentioned, in order to highlight continuity, to investigate the domain-shift from physics to mathematics, and to survey the enhancements of later physical theories. We study the works of Einstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin, Wiener, Ornstein and Uhlenbeck from 1905 to 1934 as well as experimental results, using the concept of Brownian velocity as a leading thread. We show how Brownian motion became a research topic for the mathematician Wiener in the 1920s, why his model was an idealization of physical experiments, what Ornstein and Uhlenbeck added to Einstein’s results, and how Wiener, Ornstein and Uhlenbeck developed in parallel contradictory theories concerning Brownian velocity.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address shortcomings of the method of exponential basis functions by extending it to general linear and non-linear problems. In linear problems, the solution is approximated using a linear combination of exponential functions. The coefficients are calculated such that the homogenous form of equation is satisfied on some grid. To solve non-linear problems, they are converted to into a succession of linear ones using a Newton–Kantorovich approach. The generalized exponential basis functions ({GEBF}) method developed can be implemented with greater ease compared with exponential basis functions, as all calculations can be performed using real numbers and no characteristic equation is needed. The details of an optimized implementation are described. We compare {GEBF} on some benchmark problems with methods in the literature, such as variants of the boundary element method, where {GEBF} shows a good performance. Also, in a 3D problem, we report the run time of the proposed method compared with that of Kratos, a parallel, highly optimized finite element code. The results show that in this example, to obtain the same level of error, much less computational effort is needed in the proposed method. Practical limitations might be encountered, however, for large problems because of dense matrix operations involved. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Particularly extensive coverage of spectral analysis (detecting and measuring periodic signals) includes a self-contained introduction to Fourier and discrete Fourier methods. There is a chapter devoted to Bayesian inference with Poisson sampling, and three chapters on frequentist methods help to bridge the gap between the frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

We capture digital holograms of micrometer-scale silica rods and sub-micrometer-scale Janus particles freely diﬀusing in water, and then ﬁt numerical scattering models based on the discrete dipole approximation to the measured holograms. This inverse-scattering approach allows us to extract the position and orientation of the particles as a function of time, along with static parameters including the size, shape, and refractive index. The best-ﬁt sizes and refractive indices of both particles agree well with expected values. The technique is able to track the center of mass of the rod to a precision of 35 nm and its orientation to a precision of 1.5◦, comparable to or better than the precision of other 3D diﬀusion measurements on non-spherical particles. Furthermore, the measured translational and rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcients for the silica rods agree with hydrodynamic predictions for a spherocylinder to within 0.3\%. We also show that although the Janus particles have only weak optical asymmetry, the technique can track their 2D translation and azimuthal rotation over a depth of ﬁeld of several micrometers, yielding independent measurements of the eﬀective hydrodynamic radius that agree to within 0.2\%. The internal and external consistency of these measurements validate the technique. Because the discrete dipole approximation can model scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles, our technique could be used in a range of applications, including particle tracking, microrheology, and fundamental studies of colloidal self-assembly or microbial motion.},

We observe anisotropic rotational and translational diffusion arising from the asymmetries of the clusters. In the case of the three-particle triangular cluster, we also detect a small but statistically significant difference in the rotational diffusion about the two in-plane axes. We attribute this difference to weak breaking of threefold rotational symmetry due to a small amount of particle polydispersity. Our experimental measurements agree well with numerical calculations and show how diffusion constants can be measured under conditions relevant to colloidal self-assembly, where theoretical and even numerical prediction is difficult.},

We use a model system consisting of micrometer-sized, spherical colloidal particles to study the structure and dynamics of small clusters, where the number of particles is small (N ≤ 10). The particles interact through a short-range depletion attraction with a depth of a few {kBT}. We describe two methods to form colloidal clusters, one based on isolating the particles in microwells and another based on directly assembling clusters in the gas phase using optical tweezers. We use the first technique to obtain ensemble-averaged probabilities of cluster structures as a function of N. These experiments show that clusters with symmetries compatible with crystalline order are rarely formed under equilibrium conditions. We use the second technique to study the dynamics of the clusters, and in particular how they transition between free-energy minima. To monitor the clusters we use a fast three-dimensional imaging technique, digital holographic microscopy, that can resolve the positions of each particle in the cluster with 30–45 nm precision on millisecond timescales. The real-space measurements allow us to obtain estimates for the lifetimes of the energy minima and the transition states. It is not yet clear whether the observed dynamics are relevant for small nuclei, which may not have sufficient time to transition between states before other particles or clusters attach to them. However, the measurements do provide some glimpses into how systems containing a small number of particles traverse their free-energy landscape.},

Conventionally approached with heuristic algorithms, this image analysis problem can be solved faster and more generally with machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate that two popular machine-learning algorithms, cascade classifiers and deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}), can solve the feature-localization problem orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our {CNN} implementation localizes holographic features precisely enough to bootstrap more detailed analyses based on the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering.

Analyzing one colloidal particle’s hologram with the Lorenz–Mie theory of light scattering yields the particle’s three-dimensional position with nanometer precision while simultaneously reporting its size and refractive index with part-per-thousand resolution. Analyzing a few thousand holograms in this way provides a comprehensive picture of the particles that make up a dispersion, even for complex multicomponent systems. All of this valuable information comes at the cost of three computationally expensive steps: (1) identifying and localizing features of interest within recorded holograms, (2) estimating each particle’s properties based on characteristics of the associated features, and finally (3) optimizing those estimates through pixel-by-pixel fits to a generative model. Here, we demonstrate an end-to-end implementation that is based entirely on machine-learning techniques. Characterizing and Tracking Colloids Holographically ({CATCH}) with deep convolutional neural networks is fast enough for real-time applications and otherwise outperforms conventional analytical algorithms, particularly for heterogeneous and crowded samples.
