\section{Stochastic inference of surface-induced effects using Brownian motion}

\subsection{Confined Brownian motion theory}

By observing the trajectory along the $z$ axis of a particle of $1.5 ~ \mathrm{\mu m} $ as shown on the fig.\ref{Fig:exp_z_traj}, one can see that the particle height does not get heigher than $ \simeq 4 ~ \mathrm{\mu m}$. Indeed due to gravity, the particle is confined near the surface. Brownian motion in confinement and at interfaces is a canonical situation, encountered from fundamental biophysics  to  nanoscale  engineering. This confinement induces near-wall effects, such as hindered mobility and electrostatic interactions. 

In the first part of this chapter, I will detail the theory background of the confined Brownian motion and how to numerically simulate it. In a second part, I will present how to analyse experimental data. In particular, I will detail a multi-fitting procedure that allows a thermal-noise-limited inference of diffsion coefficients spatially resolved at the nanoscale, equilibrium potentials, and forces at the femtomewton resolution.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gravitational interactions}


In our experiment, we observe confined Brownian motion since the colloids are subject to gravity. Indeed, the density of the observed colloid $\rho_\mathrm{p}$ is different of the medium $\rho_\mathrm{m}$ --- in our experiment water, $\rho_\mathrm{m} = 1000 ~ \mathrm{kg.m^{-3}}$. Thus, the particle lies into a gravitational potential given by:

\begin{equation}
	U_\mathrm{g} (z) = \Delta m g z = \frac{4}{3}\pi a ^3 g \Delta \rho z ~,
	\label{eq:ug_full}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta m$ is the mass difference of the particle and a fluid sphere of the same size, $\Delta \rho$ the corresponding density difference such as $\Delta \rho = \rho_\mathrm{m} - \rho_\mathrm{p} $ and $g$ the gravitational acceleration. By invoking the definition of a distance that we call the Boltzmann length,

\begin{equation}
	\ell _\mathrm{B} = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{4/3 \pi a ^3 \Delta \rho g } ~,
\end{equation}

one can rewrite the gravitational potential Eq.\ref{eq:ug_full} as:

\begin{equation}
	U_\mathrm{g} = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{\ell _\mathrm{B}} ~.
	\label{eq:ug}
\end{equation}

The Boltzmann length $\ell_\mathrm{B}$ is the typycal gravitational decay length and represents the balance between the gravital potential and thermal energy. This distance was first measured by Perrin \cite{perrin_les_2014}, by enumerating the number of particles as a function of height to reconstruct the concentraction of the colloidal suspension that exponentially decays as $e^{- z / \ell _\mathrm{B}}$. As an exemple, in water, for a particle polystyrene, $\rho _\mathrm{p} = 1050 ~ \mathrm{kg.m^{-3}}$ and of radius $a  = 1.5 ~ \mathrm{\mu m}$ we have $\ell _\mathrm{B} = 0.58 ~ \mathrm{\mu m}$.

For particle with $\ell _\mathrm{B} >> a $, one can consider that the particle does not feel the gravity. This is particulary the case when the density of the colloids and fluid matches, in this particular case $\ell _\mathrm{B} = 0$. Thus density matching can we a way to do grativation free experiments. In the case of our experiment, we want to measure confinement induced effects, therefore, we need this gravitational interaction to have the particles near the surface. Indeed, as a particle gets larger, or, denser $\ell _\mathrm{B}$ decreases and the particle will be, in average, closer to the surface. 


\subsubsection{Sphere-wall interactions}
\label{Section:sphere-wall}

As we have seen, external forces acts on the particle such as the gravity, however it is not the only one. As the Brownian particle is close to a wall we can expect some interactions between the surfaces. In our case, we suppose that the Brownian particles do not interact between each other, which is the case for the dilute solution used. Indeed, the particles studied are at a minimum $50 ~ \mathrm{\mu m}$ apart which correspond to 10 times their size for the larger beads. 

To describes the interaction between, the Brownian particle and the wall, we use the DLVO\footnote{The DLVO theory is named after Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015}.} theory. This theory was first developed to describe the interactions between colloids to explain the stability of colloidal suspension. It describes the interactions using two forces components; the Van Der Waals force which arise form the interactions between surface's molecules and electrostatic interactions due the a double-layer formed with the ions present in the solution. 

\paragraph{Double-Layer interactions}\mbox{}\\
\vspace{0.10cm}


When a surface is immersed in water are usually charged \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015} due to a high dielectric constant $\epsilon \simeq 80$ that permit the build up of charges for low energetic price. Commonly, surface charging is done through ionization of dissociation of surface groups\footnote{For example, the dissociation of protons from surface carboxylic groups \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015} ($-$COOH $\rightarrow$ -COO$^-$ + H$^+$) which charge negatively the surface.}, from the binding of ions from the solution --- for example, adsorption of $-$OH$^-$ onto the water-air interface that charge it negatively. In the bulk, a fluid should be electrically neutral, thus the fluid contains as many ions of opposite charge. However, when a surface is charged negatively, negative ions are repelled from the surface, while positive ions are attracted towards the surface.  Therefore, a double-layer charge distribution is formed near the surface, as shown Fig.\ref{fig.taumax}-a). Experimentally, we use glass slides and polystyrene beads, that are both negatively charged in water, thus leading to repulsive double-layer. This repulsive force prevent the colloids to stick together or to the surface of the substrate. 






\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter3/images/double_layer.pdf}
	\caption{A Brownian colloid diffusing near a wall. Both wall and colloid's surface charge negatively, in consequence, a layer of positively charge ions are towards the surfaces, forming a double-layer charge distribution.}
	\label{Fig:double_layer}
\end{figure}




If the solution contains an electrolyte (ions of positive and negative charges), for example a salty solution, containing Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions. In the DLVO theory, the electrostatic field $\Psi(\vec{r})$ generated by the double layer satisfies the mean field Poisson's equation \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015}:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla ^2 \Psi(\vec{r}) = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_r \epsilon_0}  \rho_e(\vec{r})~,
	\label{Eq:poisson}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ the relative permitivity of the fluid, $\rho_e(\vec{r})$ the local charge density. The latter can be written as:

\begin{equation}
	\rho_e(\vec{r}) = e \sum _i z_i c_i (\vec{r}) ~,
	\label{Eq.3}
\end{equation}

where $e$ is the elementary charge, $i$ denotes an ionic species of valence $z_i$ and local ionic concentration $c_i(\vec{r})$ (number density). If the solution is at the thermodynamic equilibrium, the Boltzmann equation is used to calculate the local ion density such that:

\begin{equation}
	c_i(\vec{r}) = c_i ^0 \textnormal{exp}\left(\frac{z_i e \Psi(\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B} T }\right) ~,
	\label{Eq.4}
\end{equation}


where $c_i ^0$ is the bulk concentration (number density) of the ionic species $i$. By combining Eqs.\ref{Eq:poisson}, \ref{Eq.3} and \ref{Eq.4}, one can obtain the Poisson-Boltzmann equation:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla ^2 \Psi (\vec{r}) = \sum_i \frac{z_i e c_i^0}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \exp \left( - \frac{z_i e \Psi (\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) ~.
	\label{Eq:Poisson-boltzmann}
\end{equation}

Since the Poisson-Boltzmann is non-linear, it is most likely to be solve numerically. However, for simple geometry such as uniformly charged plane or sphere it can be solve analiticaly. Let consider, to simplify, that we have a monovalent electrolyte, meaning that the electrolyte is composed of two ions of valence equal to one --- Na$^+$ Cl$^-$ for example --- and $c_i ^0$ is equal to the electrolyte solution concentration $c_s^0$. In that case Eq.\ref{Eq:Poisson-boltzmann} simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\nabla ^2 \Psi (\vec{r}) &= \frac{e c_s ^0}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \left[ \exp \left( \frac{-e\Psi(\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) -  \exp \left( \frac{+e\Psi(\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) \right] \\
	& = 2 \frac{e c_s ^0}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \mathrm{sinh}  \left( \frac{e\Psi(\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) ~.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In the case, where the $\Psi$ is small enough everywhere to have the electrostatic potential energy $e\Psi << k_\mathrm{B} T$, which generally the case when using salty solution. In that case, it is possible, using the a Taylor approximation at the second order to write:

\begin{equation}
	\exp \left( - \frac{z_i e \Psi(\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) \simeq 1 + \frac{z_i e \Psi (\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} ~.
\end{equation}

Thus, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (Eq.\ref{Eq:Poisson-boltzmann}) becomes:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla ^2 \Psi (\vec{r}) = \sum_i \frac{z_i e c_i^0}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}  \left( 1 + \frac{z_i e \Psi (\vec{r})}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) ~.
\end{equation}

Since the fluid in the bulk, is electrically neutral, the first term vanishes as $\sum_i z_i c_i^0 = 0$. One thus have a linearized version of Eq.\ref{Eq:Poisson-boltzmann}, which is known as the Debye-HÃ¼nkel equation:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2 \Psi (\vec{r}) = \left[  \sum_i \frac{z_i ^2 e^2 c_i^0}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r  k_\mathrm{B} T}    \right] \Psi (\vec{r}) ~.
\end{equation}

From this approximation, one can identify that the term between brackets is the inverse of a distance squared. We can thus define a distance $\ell _\mathrm{D}$, the Debye length such as:

\begin{equation}
	\ell _\mathrm{D} =  \sqrt{ \sum_i\frac {\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r k_\mathrm{B} T} {z_i ^2 e^2 c_i^0}} ~.
\end{equation}

The Debye length is the characteristic length of the double-layer, and, the electrostatic interactions. For a monovalent electrolyte,  at 25 \textdegree C (298 K), the Debye length of aqueous solution is:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\ell _\mathrm{D} &= \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r k_\mathrm{B}T}{2c_s^0 e^2}}
		= \sqrt{\frac{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 78.4 \times 1.381 \times 10^{-23}  \times 298}{2 \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{26} M}} \\
		& = 0.304 \times 10^{-9} / \sqrt{M} ~ \mathrm{m} ~,
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


with M the molar concentration ($1 ~ \mathrm{M} = 1 ~ \mathrm{mol.L^{-1}} $ corresponding to a number density of $c_s^0 = 6.022 \times 10 ^{26} ~ \mathrm{ m^{-3}}$). Thus, for a salty concentration we have
 $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 0.304/ \sqrt{[\mathrm{NaCl}]} ~ \mathrm{nm}$. For exemple, for NaCl solution, one can have $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 100 ~ \mathrm{nm}$ for a concentration  $[\mathrm{NaCl}] = 9.2 ~ \mathrm{\mu M}$ and   $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 10 ~  \mathrm{nm}$ for a concentration  $[\mathrm{NaCl}] = 9.2 ~ \mathrm{mM}$.



Finally, the Debye-HÃ¼nkel approximation finally writes:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2 \Psi (\vec{r}) = \kappa^2  \Psi (\vec{r}) ~,
	\label{Eq:Debye_hu}
\end{equation}

with $\kappa = 1/\ell _\mathrm{D}$. Using the latter approximation one can compute the electrostatic potential around a sphere. Let us consider a perfect sphere of radius $a$ and charge $Qe$ of charge density $\sigma = Qe/4\pi a^2$. With $Q$ beeing the number of charge on the surface. Since the system has a spherical symmetry, one has $\Psi (\vec{r}) = \Psi(r)$ with $r = |\vec{r}|$. Using the Laplacian operator $\nabla ^2$ in the spherical coordinates, Eq.\ref{Eq:Debye_hu} writes:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{r^2}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^2 \frac{\partial \Psi(r)}{\partial r}\right)\right] = \kappa^2  \Psi (r) ~,
\end{equation}

which has a general solution:

\begin{equation}
	\Psi(r) = C_1 \frac{\exp(\kappa r)}{r} + C_2 \frac{-\exp(\kappa r)}{r}
\end{equation}

For one sphere, the electrostatic field vanishes at infinity such as $C_1 = 0$, such it has the form of a Yukawa potential:

\begin{equation}
	\Psi (r) = C_2 \frac{-\exp(\kappa r)}{r} ~.
	\label{eq:yuka}
\end{equation}

Additionally, at the surface of a charged sphere, the eletrostatic potential satifies:

\begin{equation}
\left. \frac{\partial{\Psi (r)}}{\partial r} \right|_{r=a} = \frac{Qe}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r a^2}  = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} ~.
\end{equation}

By applying the latter boundary condition to Eq.\ref{eq:yuka} we find:

\begin{equation}
	\Psi (r) = \frac{\sigma a^2}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \frac{\exp (\kappa a)}{1 + \kappa a} \frac{\exp (-\kappa r)}{r}
\end{equation}

This solution can be used to determine the  electrostatic field between two spheres. Indeed, if we suppose that the presence of a second sphere, do not interfere with the distribution of ions in the double layer of the other. We can thus use the superposition approximation to write the potential $\Psi _2 (z)$ between two spheres surfaces. Where $z$ is the distance between the 2 colloids. For two spheres of charge $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ and radius $a_1$ and $a_2$, $\Psi_2 (z)$ writes \cite{bell_approximate_1970}:

\begin{equation}
	\Psi(z) = \frac{4\pi}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} 
	\left(
	\frac{\sigma_1 a_1 ^2}{1 + \kappa a_1}
	\right)
	\left(
	\frac{\sigma_2 a_2 ^2}{1 + \kappa a_2}
	\right)
	\frac{\exp(-\kappa z)}{a_1 + a_2 + z} ~.
\end{equation} 

From the latter equation, it is possible to write the electrostatic field between a wall and a spherical colloid, by setting one of the radius to infinity. Doing so and mulitplying by $e$, one can have the eltrostatic potential $E_\mathrm{elec}(z)$ between a Brownian particle and the wall:

\begin{equation}
	E_{elec} (z) = B \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}}~.
	\label{Eq:Uelec}
\end{equation}

Where B is the constant that represent the surface charges, for sphere of radius $a$ and charge $\sigma_1$ and a wall of charge $\sigma_2$, one has:

\begin{equation}
	B = \frac{4 \pi}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \left( \frac{\sigma_1 a^2 }{1 + \kappa a}  \right) \frac{\sigma_2}{\kappa} ~.
\end{equation}

 Additionally, $B$ is often written as a function of the surfaces potential as [CITE PRIEVES]:

\begin{equation}
	B = 16 \epsilon_r \epsilon_0 \left(\frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{e}\right) \tanh \left(\frac{e\phi_1}{4k_\mathrm{B}T}\right) \tanh \left(\frac{e\phi_2}{4k_\mathrm{B}T}\right) ~,
\end{equation}
 where $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are the Stern potentials of the sphere and the wall surfaces. Typical values for $B$ ranges from 1 $k_\mathrm{B}T$ to $50 ~ k_\mathrm{B}T$. In our study we will keep $B$ to describe the electrostatic energy potential as it complicated to decouple the $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ when the colloid and wall's surface materials are different \cite{behrens_charge_2001}. However, this is not impossible and is the idea of future work.

\paragraph{Van der Waals interactions}\mbox{}\\
\vspace{0.10cm}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter3/images/vdw_scheme.pdf}
	\caption{A colloid of radius $a$ separated from a wall from a distance $z$. The colloid material has a static dielectric constant $\epsilon_1$, the wall $\epsilon_2$ and the solution $\epsilon_3$. }
	\label{Fig:vdw}
\end{figure}

In the DLVO theory, the Van der Waals forces describes the interaction between colloids at very short range. This forces are mainly attractive and in our case having Van der Waals interactions would lead to the particles stick to the wall. The Van der Waals potential energy $E_{VdW}$ for a spherical colloid of radius $a$, at a height $z$  at a few nanometers ($< 5$ nm) to the surface \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015}:

\begin{equation}
	E_{VdW} = -\frac{A a}{6z} 
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the retarded Hamaker constant. For our system, where the particle, medium and wall are different medium as schematize in Fig.\ref{Fig:vdw}. In that case the Hamaker constant writes \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015}:

\begin{equation}
	A = \frac{3}{4} k_\mathrm{B}T \left(
	\frac{\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_3}{\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_3}
	\right)
	\left(
	\frac{\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_3}{\epsilon_2 + \epsilon_3}
	\right)
	+
	\frac{3h}{4\pi}
	\int_{\nu_1}^{\infty}
	\left(
	\frac{\epsilon_1 (i\nu) - \epsilon_3 (i\nu)}{\epsilon_1 (i\nu) + \epsilon_3 (i\nu)}
	\right)
	\left(
	\frac{\epsilon_2 (i\nu) - \epsilon_3 (i\nu)}{\epsilon_2 (i\nu) + \epsilon_3 (i\nu)}
	\right)
	\textnormal{d}\nu ~,
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ are the static dieletric constants of the three media, $\epsilon (i\nu)$ are the imaginary dieletric constant at a frequency $\nu$ and $\nu_n = (2 \pi k_\mathrm{B}Tn/h = 4 \times 10^{13} n s^{-1}$ at $300$ K; and; h is the Plank's constant. The first term fives the zero-frequency energy of the van der Waals interaction and the second term the dispersion energy.
However, since the static dielectric of water is large compared to the other terms \cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015}, one can approximate the Hamaker constant of our system to only the zero-frequency term:

\begin{equation}
	A = \frac{3}{4} 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 298 
	\left(
	\frac{2.5 - 80}{2.5 + 80}
	\right)
	\left(
	\frac{5 - 80}{5 + 80}
	\right)
	\simeq
	2.48 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{J}	= 0.62 ~ k_\mathrm{B}T ~.
\end{equation}

Since $A$ is positive we correctly have an attractive Van der Waals force, this case will always be the case due to the high dielectric constant of water. More over, the zero-frequency Van der Waals force is mainly due to electrostatic interaction and is thus screened by electrolytes, we thus need to add a factor $\approx e^{-z/\ell_D}$ to the Van der Waals forces. Also, it has been proposed \cite{gregory_approximate_1981} that to compute the force at higher distances, one should add a second factor, to account for the retarded Van der Waals force of $ \simeq (1  + 11z/100 \mathrm{nm})^{-1}$. 


All the effects added together we can see that the Van der Waals forces will play a role only a few nanometer ($< 10$ nm) as it is commonly observed [M,P]. In our experiments, the Debye length $\ell _\mathrm{D}$ ($>20$ nm) is large enough for the particle to avoid this region, in the following of this work the Van der Waals interactions will be neglected. To study the Van der Waals interactions with Brownian motion, it is possible, if one add enough salt to have $\ell_\mathrm{D} \simeq 1$ nm. However, with such a short Debye length, all the colloids would stick to the surface and between each other. However, we have experimentally observed some dynamics on the sucked particles, further work on this movement could lead to interesting determination of the near-wall potential. 

\newpage

\paragraph{Total potential and equilibrium distribution}\mbox{}\\
\label{test}
\vspace{0.10cm}

If we combine the gravitational and electrostatic interactions the particules lies into a total energy potential $U(z)$:

\begin{equation}
	U(z) = U_\mathrm{g} + U_\mathrm{elec}
	\label{eq:uz}
\end{equation}

By combining Eqs.\ref{eq:ug}, \ref{Eq:Uelec} and \ref{eq:uz}, and also adding the condition that the particle can't go inside the wall $U(z)$ finally writes:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{U(z)}{k_\mathrm{B}T} =  \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		\displaystyle B\,\textrm{e}^{-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}} + \frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{B}}\ ,\quad \text{ for } z>0 \\
		+\infty\ ,\quad  \text{ for } z\leq 0
	\end{array}
	\right. \ ,
	\label{Eq:PDF}
\end{equation}

From this total potential energy, one can then construct the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution to write the equilibrium \gls{PDF} of position $P_{\mathrm{eq}}(z)$:

\begin{equation}
	P_\mathrm{eq} (z)  = A \exp \left( -\frac{U(z)}{k_\mathrm{B}T} \right) ~,
	\label{Eq.Peq}
\end{equation} 

where A is a normalization constant such that $\int_{0}^{\infty}P_\mathrm{eq}(z)\textnormal{d}z = 1$. Given an array of heights $z_i$ one can use compute $P_\mathrm{eq}$ using the following Python snippet, where the $A$ is computed using the \mintinline{python}{np.trapz} function. An example of a theoretical energy potential and \gls{PDF} of position can be seen Fig.\ref{Fig:potential} for $\ell_\mathrm{B} = 500 ~ \mathrm{nm} $,  $B = 4 ~k_\mathrm{B}T$ and $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 50 ~ \mathrm{nm}$.

\subsubsection{Local diffusion coefficient}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter1/image/libchaber.pdf}
	\caption{Figure extracted from \cite{faucheux_confined_1994}, on the left is the experimental setup used. It is an inverted microscope used in order to track particle of size $2R$ inside a cell of thickness $t$. On the right is their final result, where they measure the diffusion parallel coefficient $D_\bot$ given by Eq.\ref{Eq:etax}, here normalized by $D_0$ the bulk diffusion coefficient as a function of  $\gamma$ a confinement constant $\gamma = (\langle z \rangle -a)/a$. }
	\label{fig:libchaber}
\end{figure}


As we have seen in the Chapter 2, for a freely diffusing colloid in bulk the diffusion coefficient is given by Eq.\ref{Eq:D_einstein} and is a constant. However, when a particle is confined, the diffusion is hindered, this means that the diffusion coefficient vary with the height of the particle and becomes anisotropic. One of the first measurement that has been done by Faucheux and Libchaber \cite{faucheux_confined_1994}. As we can see on the Fig.\ref{fig:libchaber}, using a microscope, they tracked Brownian colloids in two dimensions, and, measured the average coefficient diffusion for different confinement constant $\gamma = (\langle z\rangle_t - a) / a$. Finally, on the Fig.\ref{fig:libchaber}, one can observe that the diffusion coefficient parallel to the surface decreases as the particle get closer to the wall, and, seems to saturate around $0.3D_0$ for high confinement. 
\newpage

To understand the reason of this hindered diffusion coefficient, let us start by writing the diffusion coefficient $D$ using the fluctuation dissipation theorem:

\begin{equation}
	D = \mu k_\mathrm{B}T ~,
	\label{Eq.fluc}
\end{equation}

with:

\begin{equation}
	\mu = \frac{v_\mathrm{sphere}}{F_\mathrm{drag}} ~,
	\label{Eq.mu}
\end{equation}

where $v_\mathrm{sphere}$ is the terminal velocity to an applied force $F_\mathrm{drag}$. For a spherical colloid of radius $R$ moving at a velocity $v_\mathrm{sphere}$ the drag force in bulk $F_{\mathrm{drag}} ^\mathrm{B}$ is given by the Stockes' law:

\begin{equation}
	F_\mathrm{drag} ^\mathrm{B} = c \pi \eta a v_\mathrm{sphere} ~,
	\label{Eq.drag}
\end{equation}

where $c$ is a constant that depends on the boundary conditions imposed at the surface of the colloid, typically $c = 6$ for no-slip  and $c = 4$ (such as air bubbles for example) for slip boundary conditions. Combining Eqs.\ref{Eq.fluc}, \ref{Eq.mu} and \ref{Eq.drag} for a freely diffusing hard sphere in bulk we retrieve Eq.\ref{Eq:D_einstein}: 

\begin{equation}
	D_0 = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{6\pi \eta a} ~.
	\label{Eq.D}
\end{equation}

The Stocke's drag force can be computed by solving the Navier-Stokes equation:

\begin{equation}
	\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial} + \left(\vec{v} \cdot \nabla \vec{v} \right) \right] + \nabla p = \eta \nabla ^2 \vec{v} ~,
	\label{Eq.Navier}
\end{equation}

and the continuity equation for incrompressible fluids:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla \cdot \vec{v} = 0
	\label{Eq.continuity}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{v}$ and $p$ is the velocity and pressure fields $\rho$ is the density of the fluid. When the Reynolds number $Re = \rho a v_\mathrm{sphere} / \eta \ll 1$,  the first two terms are inertial and are negligibly small compared to the viscous term $\eta \nabla ^2 \vec{v}$. In that case, the Navier-Stokes Eq.\ref{Eq.Navier}, is simplified to the Stockes flow formula:

\begin{equation}
	\nabla p = \eta \nabla ^2 \vec{v}
	\label{Eq.Stokesflow}
\end{equation}

The diffusion coefficient for a freely diffusing spherical colloid in bulk can thus be found by solving Eqs.\ref{Eq.Stokesflow} and \ref{Eq.continuity} by having a no-slip boundary condition on the particle surface and the velocity vanishing at infinity. However, in the case of a confined particle, there is an additional no-slip condition at the wall surface. Indeed, as shown on the Fig.\ref{fig.shear}, the fluid velocity drop to zero at the wall surface, with a shear rate:

\begin{equation}
	\dot{\gamma} = \frac{\partial v_\mathrm{sphere}}{\partial z}
\end{equation} 

This shear rate, due to the presence of the wall introduce a shear force $F(z) = \simeq \eta \dot{\gamma} (z) $ acting on the particle. Hence, the drag force acting on the particle will increase inversely with the distance to the wall, due to additional hydrodynamic pressure arising from velocity gradients. At the macro scale, this effect can be seen with a frisbee, indeed, as it gets closer to the grounds, hydrodynamic pressure increases due to air velocity gradient and one can observe that the frisbee seems to stop falling and continue to glide really near the ground's surface.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter3/images/draw_shear/shear.pdf}
	\caption{Schematic representation of a spherical colloid moving near a wall and the induced shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$.} 
	\label{fig.shear}
\end{figure}

A colloid diffusing near a wall thus experience a local drag force that depends on both it's distance to the wall $z$ and the movement direction. Thanks to the linearity of the Stokes equation, one can seperate this local drag force for motion parrallel and perpendicular to the wall. As the presence of the wall correct the drag force from a multiplicative coefficient, the confinement effect often expressed as an effective viscosity:

\begin{equation}
	\eta _\bot (z) = {\eta}{\lambda _ \bot (z)}  ~ \text{, and, } ~\eta _\parallel (z) =  {\eta}{\lambda _ \parallel (z)}~,
\end{equation}

where $\lambda _\bot$ and $\lambda _\parallel$ are respectively perpendicular and parallel correction factor to the drag force due to the presence of the wall. Due to this correction, the diffusion coefficients for parallel and perpendicular motion relative to the wall writes:

\begin{equation}
	D_\bot (z) =  \frac{D_0}{\lambda _\bot (z)}  ~, \text{ and, } D_\parallel (z) = \frac{D_0}{ \lambda_\parallel (z)} ~.
\end{equation}
 
For a no-slip boundary conditions imposed at the wall and the surface of the colloid, Brenner \cite{brenner_slow_1961} obtained for perpendicular motion:


\begin{equation}
	\lambda_ \bot (z) = \frac{4}{3}  \mathrm{sinh}\beta \sum _{n=1} ^{\infty} \frac{n(n+1)}{(2n-1)(2n+3)}
	\left[
	\frac
	{
		2\mathrm{sinh}(2n + 1)\beta + (2n +1)\mathrm{sinh}2\beta
	}
	{
		4\mathrm{sinh}^2(n + 1 /2)\beta  - (2n+1)^2 \mathrm{sinh}^2 \beta
	}
	-1
	\right] ~,
	\label{Eq:etaz}
\end{equation}

where $\beta = \cosh ^{-1} ((z+a)/a)$. The solution for the diffusion parallel to the wall, FaxÃ©n found \cite{faxen_fredholm_1924}:

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_\parallel(z) = 
	\left[
	1 - \frac{9}{16} \xi + \frac{1}{8}\xi^3 - \frac{45}{256}\xi^4 - \frac{1}{16}\xi^5
	\right]^{-1}~,
	\label{Eq:etax}
\end{equation}

where $\xi  = a / (z+a)$. Eqs.\ref{Eq:etaz} and \ref{Eq:etax} are precise for all $z$. However, the solution for the perpendicular motion can be quite complex to compute as it is an infinite series, to be computed numerically it requires a software that enable arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic\footnote{Arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic enables to evaluate mathematical expression with any precision, in other words, any number of digits.} --- such as Mathematica or the \mintinline{python}{mpmath} Python's module for example. $D_\bot$ can be evaluated using the following Python snippet, where \mintinline{python}|nsum| function is used to compute the infinite sum:  


\begin{minted}
	[
	frame=lines,
	framesep=2mm,
	baselinestretch=1.2,
	fontsize=\footnotesize,
	linenos
	]
	{python}
from mpmath import nsum	

def Dz(eta, z, a):
  a = (z + a) / a
  beta = float(acosh(a))
  summ = nsum(
    lambda n: (n * (n + 1) / ((2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 3)))
    * (
      (
        (2 * sinh((2 * n + 1) * xi) + (2 * n + 1) * sinh(2 * beta))
        / (
            4 * (sinh((n + 1 / 2) * beta) ** 2)
            - ((2 * n + 1) ** 2) * (sinh(beta) ** 2)
        )
      )
      - 1
    ),
    [0, inf],
    )
  summ = float(summ)
  return kT / (6 * pi * eta * 4 / 3 * float(sinh(beta)) * summ * a)
\end{minted}

To simplify the computation of $\lambda_\bot$, Goldman \textit{et al.} \cite{goldman_slow_1967} showed that Eq.\ref{Eq:etaz} can be PadÃ© approximated, giving:

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_\bot =  \frac{6z^2 + 9az + 2a^2}{6z^2 + 2az}~.
	\label{Eq:etaz_pade}
\end{equation}

In the near-wall regime, such that $z \ll a$, it is also possible to further approximate $\lambda_\bot$ to:

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_\bot = \frac{a}{z} ~.
	\label{Eq:etaz_small}
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter3/images/theory_lambda/hindered_diffusion.pdf}

	\label{fig.etaz}
\end{figure}


The PadÃ© approximation and the near-wall approximation for the hindered diffusion are plotted on Fig.\ref{fig.etaz}-b). The PadÃ© approximation fits really well with the exact solution given by the infinite sum Eq.\ref{Eq:etaz}, the near-wall approximation fits well when $z < a / 10$. To check how precise the approximation are, it is possible to plot the relative error as in the Fig.\ref{fig.etaz}-c). The PadÃ© approximation shows a precision up to 1\%, thus, in the following of this work, when we refer to any evaluation of the hindered perpendicular diffusion, the PadÃ© approximation will be used. 


\subsubsection{Langevin equation for the confined Brownian motion}

Now that the external forces acting on the particle and hindered diffusion coefficient is known, we rewrite the overdamped Langevin Eq.\ref{Eq.overdamped_SDE} equation as:

\begin{equation}
	V_t^i \textnormal{d}t  = -\frac{1}{\gamma(z)}\frac{\partial U(z)}{\partial x_i}  \textnormal{d}t + \sqrt{2D_i (z)}  \textnormal{d}B_t ~.
	\label{Eq:langevin_z}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma(z) = 6 \pi \eta_i(z) a$ and $i$ denotes three spatial directions, $x,~ y$ and $z$\footnote{Where the previously determined $\eta_\parallel$ and $D_\parallel$ correspond to the $x$ and $y$ axis and $\eta_\bot$ and $D_\bot$ correspond to the $z$ axis.}, and,  $ \textnormal{d}B_t$ still is a Gaussian distribution satisfying $\langle \textnormal{d}B_t \rangle = 0$ and $\langle \textnormal{d}B_t ^2 \rangle = \textnormal{d}t$. As we have discussed previously, the potential $U$ only varies along the $z$ axis, thus, the external forces only acts on the particle on the $z$ axis while the particle diffuses freely along the $x$ and $y$ axis. 

\subsubsection{Spurious drift}

It is interesting to observe that due to the hindered diffusion the magnitude of the Langevin force, $\sqrt{2D_i(z)}$, is not anymore a constant, but varies with the height of the particle. This effect is called multiplicative noise and will have some interesting effects on the dynamics properties of the Brownian motion. To show the effects of the multiplicative noise, one can integrate over a time $\tau$ the Eq.\ref{Eq:langevin_z}, in the absence of the external force one has:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta x_i = \int_{t_0} ^{t_0 + \tau} \sqrt{2D_i(z)}\textnormal{d}B_t
	\label{int}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta x_i$ is a space increment. However, the noise term is not well-defined and the time at which the magnitude of the force $\sqrt{2D_i(z)}$ in the integration Eq.\ref{int} needs to be specified. It is thus necessary to determine where the Diffusion coefficient $D(z)$ in Eq.\ref{int} is evaluated in the time interval $[t_0, t_0 + \tau]$. In general, $D(z)$ is represented by $D(z + \alpha \Delta z)$, or in the same way $D(z(t_0 + \alpha \tau))$, with $\alpha \in [0,1]$. The value of $\alpha$ determines at which time in the interval   $[t_0, t_0 + \tau]$ the local diffusion is evaluated, hence, the magnitude of the random force. The physics will thus change on how the noise is calculated, however, the requirement is that the long-time thermal equilibrium must be consistent with the Boltzmann distribution and, hence, constrain the choice of $\alpha$. Taking into account $\alpha$, the langevin equation without external \ref{int} forces along the $z$ axis becomes:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta z  = \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z + \alpha \Delta z)} d B_t ~.
	\label{int2}
\end{equation}

By Taylor expendig $D_ \parallel$ to the first order one has:

\begin{equation}
	D_\parallel (z + \alpha \Delta z) \simeq D_\parallel (z)  + \alpha \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \Delta z ~.
\end{equation}

Substituting the later in Eq.\ref{int2} leads to:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\Delta z &\simeq \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)  + \alpha \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \Delta z} d B_t  \\
		& = \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \left[1 + \alpha \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \frac{\Delta z }{D_\parallel(z)}\right] ^{-1/2} \textnormal{d} B_t  ~.
	\end{aligned}
	\label{int3}
\end{equation}

Additionally, since the last term satisfies:

\begin{equation}
	\alpha \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \frac{\Delta z }{D_\parallel(z)} \ll 1 ~,
\end{equation}

one can thus Taylor expend at the first order the last term of Eq.\ref{int3} as:

\begin{equation}
	\left[1 + \alpha \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \frac{\Delta z }{D_\parallel(z)}\right] ^{-1/2} \simeq 1 + \frac{\alpha }{2}\frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \frac{\Delta z }{D_\parallel(z)} ~.
\end{equation}

By finally substituting the first-order expansion of $\Delta z \simeq \sqrt{2D(z)} \textnormal{d}B_t$, we obtain:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\Delta z & \simeq \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \left[1 + \frac{\alpha }{2} \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \frac{\Delta z }{D_\parallel(z)}\right]  \textnormal{d} B_t \\
		& \simeq \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \left[1 + \frac{\alpha }{2} \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \frac{\sqrt{2D(z)} \textnormal{d}B_t }{D_\parallel(z)}\right]  \textnormal{d} B_t \\
		& =  \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \textnormal{d}B_t + \alpha  \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \textnormal{d} B_t ^2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}



Since for short time $\textnormal{d}B_t \rightarrow 0$ it is possible to replace $\textnormal{d}B_t ^2$ by its average value  $\langle \textnormal{d}B_t ^2 \rangle _t = \tau$, the latter thus become \cite{ikeda_stochastic_2014}: 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\Delta z &=   \alpha  \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z}  \tau - \frac{1}{\gamma(z)}\frac{\partial U(z)}{\partial z}  \tau + \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \textnormal{d}B_t \\
	&=  \left( - \frac{1}{\gamma(z)}\frac{\partial U(z)}{\partial z} +  \alpha  \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z} \right) \tau + \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \textnormal{d}B_t \\
	&= \bar{v}_\textnormal{d}\tau  + \sqrt{2D_\parallel (z)} \textnormal{d}B_t ~,
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
	\bar{v}_\textnormal{d} = - \frac{1}{\gamma(z)}\frac{\partial U(z)}{\partial z} +  \alpha  \frac{\textnormal{d} D_\parallel(z)}{\textnormal{d}z}  = v_\textnormal{d} + v_\textnormal{noise}~,
	\label{Eq.total_drifts}
\end{equation}

are the total drifts acting on the particle. The first term $v_\textnormal{d}$ is the drift  due to ``real" deterministic forces due to the electrostatic double-layer and gravity interactions, while the second term $ v_\textnormal{noise}$ represents a noise induced drift. This spurious drift does disappear when the coefficient diffusion is homogeneous as for the $x$ and $y$ axis as the coefficient diffusion only depends on the colloid's height. Theoretically, $\alpha$ can take any value between 0 and 1. However, $\alpha$ generally takes 3 different values \cite{volpe_effective_2016}:  $\alpha = 0$, the ItÃ´ integral, coresponding to the use of the initial value of $D(z)$; $\alpha = 1/2$, the Stratonovich integral, corresponding to the mid-point value; and $\alpha = 1$ the anti-ItÃ´ or isothermal integral, corresponding to the use of the final value. 

In particular, the ItÃ´ integral $\alpha = 0$ is commonly used in economics and biology as integrals are approximated by a sum, the first point of the integral is chosen.  The Stratonovich integral $\alpha = 1/2$ arises in Physical systems where noise correlation time $\tau _\mathrm{c} > 0$, and, where the velocities are often computed at mid-points using three measurements. Finally, the isothermal integral $\alpha = 1$ is used in physical systems at equilibrium with a heat bath \cite{volpe_influence_2010} such as our case with Brownian motion. Using the PadÃ© approximation Eq.\ref{Eq:etaz_pade}, the spurious drift $v_\textnormal{noise}$ writes:

\begin{equation}
	v_\textnormal{noise} (z)= 2 \alpha D_0 a\frac{2a^2 + 12 az + 21 z^2}{(2 a^2 + 9az + z^2) ^2} ~,
	\label{Eq.spurious_drift}
\end{equation}

and the deterministic part of the drift writes:

\begin{equation}
	v_\textnormal{d} =- \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{\gamma(z)} \left[- \frac{1}{\ell_\mathrm{D}} B \exp \left(- \frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right) + \frac{1}{\ell_\mathrm{B}}\right] ~.
\end{equation}
Finally, the langevin equation for a confined colloid near a wall writes:

\begin{equation}
		V_t^i \textnormal{d}t  = \bar{v}_\mathrm{d} ^i \textnormal{d}t + \sqrt{2D_i (z)}  \textnormal{d}B_t ~,
		\label{Eq.langevin_confined}
\end{equation}

where the drifts $\bar{v}_\mathrm{d} ^i $ are non-zero only for the $z$ axis. A typical example of drift velocity for a colloidal particle of radius $a = 1.5 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ in water, confined in interaction potential with a Debye length $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 50 ~ \mathrm{nm}$, $B = 4 ~k_\mathrm{B}T$ and a Boltzmann length $\ell_\mathrm{B} = 500 ~ \mathrm{nm}$, is plotted in Fig.\ref{fig.spurious}. As one can observe, the spurious drift is not negligible, and, even the presence of this additional drift doubles the total drift $\bar{v}_\mathrm{d}$ near the surface.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fokker-Plank equation}

The Fokker-Plank equation is an alternative way to describe Brownian motion. Instead of explicitly calculating a Brownian trajectory by solving the Langevin equation, Fokker-Plank equation describes the particle distribution function $P(x, x_0; t)$ where $x$ denotes the particle position and $x_0$ its initial position. To derive the Fokker-Plank plank equation, let us start by taking generic Langevin equation:

\begin{equation}
	\textnormal{d}X_t = u(X_t) \textnormal{d}t + a(X_t)\textnormal{d}B_t ~,
	\label{SDE2}
\end{equation}

where $X_t$ is the particle position,  $u$ is the drift due to external forces and $a$ the magnitude of the random force. Let consider the average value of an arbitrary function $f(X_t)$ for a stochastic process obeying Eq.\ref{SDE2}, that started at position $x_0$ at time $t=0$, by definition \cite{le_bellac_equilibrium_2004}:

\begin{equation}
	\langle f(X_t) \rangle = \int \textnormal{d}x ~ p(x, x_0 ; t) f(x) ~,
	\label{fokker1}
\end{equation}

with the initial conditions that can be written as:

\begin{equation}
	p(x, x_0; 0) = \delta (x - x_0) ~.
\end{equation}

We now take the time derivative of Eq.\ref{fokker1}, we start by expending $ f$ at the $\textnormal{d}t$ as:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\left\langle \frac{\textnormal{d}f(X_t)}{\textnormal{d}t} \right\rangle  &= \frac{\textnormal{d}}{\textnormal{dt}}\left\langle   \frac{\partial f(X_t)}{\partial x} u(X_t) \textnormal{d}t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f(X_t)}{\partial x^2} a^2 (X_t) \textnormal{d}B_t^2   \right\rangle \\
	& =  \frac{\textnormal{d}}{\textnormal{dt}} \left( \frac{\partial f(X_t)}{\partial x} u(X_t) \textnormal{d}t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f(X_t)}{\partial x^2} a^2 (X_t) \textnormal{d}t \right) \\
	& = \frac{\partial f(X_t)}{\partial x} u(X_t) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f(X_t)}{\partial x^2} a^2 (X_t) ~.
	\end{aligned}
	\label{fokker2}
\end{equation}

By combining Eqs.\ref{fokker1} and \ref{fokker2}, we get:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\left\langle \frac{\textnormal{d}f(X_t)}{\textnormal{d}t} \right\rangle &= \int \textnormal{d} x ~\frac{\partial p(x, x_0 ; t) }{\partial t} f(x) \\
	& =  \frac{\partial f(X_t)}{\partial x} u(X_t) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f(X_t)}{\partial x^2} a^2 (X_t) \\
	& = \int \textnormal{d}x ~ p(x, x_0 ; t) G f(x) ~,
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where G in an operator called the generator and is define by its action on a function $f$ by:

\begin{equation}
	Gf = \frac{1}{2} a^2 (x) \frac{\partial ^2 f(x)}{\partial x^2} + u(x) \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x} ~.
\end{equation}

Using the definition of the adjoint of $G$, denoted by $G ^\dagger$, one has:


\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\int \textnormal{d} x ~\frac{\partial p(x, x_0 ; t) }{\partial t} f(x) &= \int \textnormal{d}x ~ p(x, x_0 ; t) G f(x) \\
	&= \int \textnormal{d}x ~  G ^\dagger p(x, x_0 ; t) f(x) ~.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

From the latter, we thus have:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial p(x, x_0 ; t)}{\partial t} = G^\dagger p(x, x_0 ; t) ~.
	\label{fokker3}
\end{equation}

Which leads to the Forward-Fokker-Planck equation:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial p(x, x_0 ; t)}{\partial t }= \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x^2} \left[\frac{a^2 (x)}{2}p(x, x_0 ; t)\right] - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[u(x) p(x, x_0 ; t)\right]
	\label{Eq.Forward_Fokker_plank}
\end{equation}

The latter is called Forward because the partial differential equation is in terms of the variable $x$, the position of the particle at which the stochastic process ends up, at time $t$. For a confined Brownian motion near a wall, using the previously determined drifts $\bar{v}_\textnormal{d}$ Eq.\ref{Eq.total_drifts}, the Fokker-Plank equation for the movement along the $z$ axis, perpendicular to the wall writes:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial p(z, z_0 ; t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial z ^2} \left[ D(z)  p(z, z_0 ; t) \right]   -  \frac{\partial }{\partial z} \left[\bar{v}_\textnormal{d} p(z, z_0 ; t)\right] ~.
\end{equation}

As an example, the stationary solution of the latter, $\partial p / \partial t = 0$, is given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann ditribution $P_\textnormal{eq}(z) $ (Eq.\ref{Eq.Peq}). The solution for the Eq.\ref{fokker3} with the particle starting at position $z_0$, at time $t_0 = 0$ writes:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	P(z, z_0; t) &= \exp (G^\dagger t) p(z, z_0, 0) \\
	& = \exp \left( \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial z ^2}  D(z)  t   -  \frac{\partial }{\partial z} \bar{v}_\textnormal{d} t\right) \delta (z - z_0)
	\end{aligned}
	\label{Eq.solfokker}
\end{equation} 

\subsubsection{Numerical simulation of confined Brownian motion}

We had previously determined with that the simulation of a bulk Brownian motion, without external forces can by the simple formula (Eq.\ref{Eq.shortnumlangevin}): 

\begin{equation}
	x_i = x_{i-1} + \sqrt{2D}w_i~.
\end{equation}

However, with the confined Brownian motion one needs to take into account the hindered diffusion, external forces due to gravity and double-layer interactions and the noise-induced drift. Putting all that together, leads to a new equation for $x_i$ which writes for the movement parrallel to wall:

\begin{equation}
	x_i = x_{i-1} +  \sqrt{2D_\parallel}w_i ~,
\end{equation}

where $i$ represents $x$ and $y$ axis. For the particle movement perpendicularly to the wall ($z$ axis), one needs to add the total drift $\bar{v}_\textnormal{d}$ Eq.\ref{Eq.total_drifts}, such that:

\begin{equation}
	z_i = z_{i-1} + \bar{v}_\mathrm{d}(z_{i-1}) \tau + \sqrt{2D_\bot}w_i ~,
\end{equation}

where $\tau$ is the simulation time step and $w_i$ being a Gaussian distribution of mean value $\langle w_i \rangle = 0$ and variance $\langle w_i ^2\rangle = \tau$. Unlike the bulk Brownian motion where the time step $\tau$ can be chosen for the desired precision as shown previously on Fig.\ref{fig:MSEwi}; for an accurate simulation, the time-step should here be short enough for the drifts $\bar{v}_\textnormal{d}$ and local diffusion coefficient to be relatively constant in the time periods $t_{i+1} - t_i = \tau$ and in the displacement range $\Delta z = z_{i+1} - z_i$, such that:

\begin{equation}
	\bar{v}_\mathrm{d} (z \in [z_i, z_{i+1}]) \simeq \bar{v}_\mathrm{d} (z_i) ~,
	\label{driftc}
\end{equation}

and,

\begin{equation}
	D_{\bot, \parallel}(z \in [z_i, z_{i+1}]) \simeq D_{\bot, \parallel}(z_i) ~.
\end{equation}

Since that the diffusion coefficient vary less for the movement parallel one can only consider the perpendicular motion to determine the simulation time step. Also, as it can be seen on the Fig.\ref{label} where the drift $v_\textnormal{d}$ and diffusivity gradient are plotted, the diffusion gradient are negligible compared to the drift gradient, we thus focus on the drifts condition Eq.\ref{driftc}. Moreover, the drifts vary more when the colloid is near the surface where one can approximate the diffusion coefficient $D_\bot$ by the approximation Eq.\ref{Eq:etaz_small} such that:

\begin{equation}
	D_\bot ^{z\ll a} (z) = D_ 0 \frac{z}{a} ~.
\end{equation}

As near the surface, the gravitational interaction can be neglected as it is smaller that the electrostatic interactions has it has been shown on the potential plot Fig.\ref{Fig:potential}. In that case, by taking $\alpha = 1$, the total drifts Eq.\ref{Eq.total_drifts} near the surface simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\bar{v}_\textnormal{d} &=  \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{\gamma_0} \frac{z}{a} \left[\frac{B}{\ell_\mathrm{D}} \exp \left(-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right)\right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} D_0 \frac{z}{a} \\
		&= D_0 \frac{z}{a} \left[\frac{B}{\ell_\mathrm{D}} \exp \left(-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right)\right] + \frac{D_0}{a} \\
		&= \frac{D_0}{a} \left[ 1 + \frac{Bz}{\ell_\mathrm{D}} \exp \left(-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right)\right]
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

By expending the exponential term to the order $z/\ell_\mathrm{D}$ order, we get:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\bar{v}_\textnormal{d} &= \frac{D_0}{a} \left[ 1 + \frac{Bz}{\ell_\mathrm{D}} \exp \left(-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right)\right]
		 =  \frac{D_0}{a} \left[ 1 + \frac{Bz}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}  \left(1 -\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right)\right] \\
		& = \frac{D_0}{a} \left( 1 + \frac{B z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}\right)
	\end{aligned}
	\label{drifts_short}
\end{equation}

To satisfy Eq.\ref{driftc}, we need to have small relative change of drifts in an interval $[z, z+\Delta z]$ which can be written as:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\bar{v}_\mathrm{d} (z + \Delta z) - \bar{v}_\mathrm{d} (z)}{\bar{v}_\mathrm{d} (z)} \ll 1
	\label{condition_drift}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.\ref{drifts_short} and \ref{condition_drift}, we get:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta z \ll \frac{\ell_\mathrm{D}}{B} + z ~.
	\label{inegality}
\end{equation}


Using the \gls{MSD}, it is possible to link the latter to the simulation time step $\tau$ by using the average value of $\Delta z ^2 $, such that:

\begin{equation}
	\langle \Delta z ^2 \rangle (z) = 2 D_\bot (z) \tau = 2D_0 \frac{z}{a}\tau 
	\label{msdshort}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.\ref{inegality} and \ref{msdshort} thus leads to:

\begin{equation}
	\tau = \frac{a\langle \Delta z ^2 \rangle }{2 D_0 z} < \frac{a}{2 D_0 } \frac{(\frac{\ell_\mathrm{D}}{B} + z) ^2}{z} = \tau_\mathrm{max} (z)~,
	\label{taumax}
\end{equation}

where $ \tau_\mathrm{max}$ is thus the maximal time step that satifies Eq.\ref{inegality}. At this point, there is two different way to do the simulation: the first one is to do an adaptive time step where $\tau_\mathrm{max}$ for each step of the simulation ; the second one is to find the smallest $\tau_\mathrm{max}(z)$ and use for all the simulation a time step $\tau$ statisfying $\tau < \mathrm{min}(\tau_\mathrm{max}) $. The latter can be evaluated by finding the height $z_\mathrm{min}$, at which the derivative of $ \tau_\mathrm{max}$ nullifies, such that:

\begin{equation}
	\left. \frac{\partial \tau_\mathrm{max}}{\partial z} \right| _{z_\mathrm{min} }= 0 ~.
\end{equation} 

Soliving the latter gives:

\begin{equation}
	z_\mathrm{min} = \frac{\ell_\mathrm{D}}{B} ~.
\end{equation}


which finally gives a maximal simulation time step, $\mathrm{min}(\tau_\mathrm{max})$:

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{min}(\tau_\mathrm{max}) =  \frac{2 a}{D_0} \frac{\ell_\mathrm{D}}{B} ~,
\end{equation}

this time should be the maximal time step $\tau$ used for a confined Brownian simulation near a wall to ensure an accurate simulation of the near-wall effects. In the Fig.\ref{fig.taumax}-b) some typical $\tau_{\mathrm{max}}$ are plotted for a colloid of radius $a=1.5 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$, $B = 4$ and $\ell _\mathrm{D}$ varying between $20$ and $100$ nm. We can observe that for this range of values that well represents the experiments that I have done during my thesis, taking a simulation time step $\tau < 0.01 ~ \mathrm{s}$ can be used for all set of parameters.

We have developed the simulation of the Confined Brownian motion using Python, as part of the Master's internship of Ãlodie Millan, the interested reader will find more information on confined Brownian motion in more complex systems in her forthcoming thesis. A trajectory of a colloidal particle of radius $a= 1.5  ~ \mathrm{\mu m}$ of density $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 1050  ~\mathrm{kg.m^{-3}}$ and the potential characterized by $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 50$ nm and $B=4$,  is plotted in the Fig.\ref{fig.z_traj_confined_simulated} which do look like the experimental trajectory that was shown in Fig.\ref{Fig:exp_z_traj} as an introduction to the chapter. In this trajectory, the noise induced lift is taken in account by using the isothermal approach $\alpha =1 $. However, to check if it is the correct way to take into account the spurious drift, the constraint we have is that the long time statistics should satisfy the Gibbs-Boltzmann equation Eq.\ref{Eq.Peq}. To compute an experimental probability density function from a set of points, one can use the following Python snippet.


\begin{minted}
	[
	frame=lines,
	framesep=2mm,
	baselinestretch=1.2,
	fontsize=\footnotesize,
	linenos

def pdf(data, bins=10, density=True):
	
  pdf, bins_edge = np.histogram(data, bins=bins, density=density)
  bins_center = (bins_edge[0:-1] + bins_edge[1:]) / 2

  return pdf, bins_center
\end{minted}

The Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for $\alpha = 0 , 0.5 \text{ and } 1 $ is shown in Fig.\ref{fig.pdf_vs_alpha}. We see that the Isothermal integral of the noise gives the correct distribution, in the other two cases, we observe that the particle is more likely to be found nearer the surface, this is corrected by the additional spurious drift Eq.\ref{Eq.spurious_drift}.

	\label{fig.pdf_vs_alpha}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Experimental study}
\label{section:expresults}
Let us now analyze the experimental data obtain through the Mie tracking. In the theory, we wrote the height of the particle $z$ being the shortest distance between the wall and the colloidal particle surface. However, it is not the height measured by the Mie tracking, since it measure the distance between the objective lens focal plane and the particle center. To have the correct measured height, we suppose that the particle do approach the very closely to the wall. From that assumption, we then a moving minimum along the trajectory to set the minimal value of the trajectory to zero. The moving minimum can be calculated using the following Python function:



\begin{minted}
	[
	frame=lines,
	framesep=2mm,
	baselinestretch=1.2,
	fontsize=\footnotesize,
	linenos
	]
	{python}
def movmin(z, window):
  result = np.empty_like(z)
  start_pt = 0
  end_pt = int(np.ceil(window / 2))

  for i in range(len(z)):
    if i < int(np.ceil(window / 2)):
      start_pt = 0
    if i > len(z) - int(np.ceil(window / 2)):
      end_pt = len(z)
    result[i] = np.min(z[start_pt:end_pt])
    start_pt += 1
    end_pt += 1

  return result
\end{minted}

In the latter, \mintinline{python}{window} represent the number of points is used to compute the minimum. As an example, if one chose \mintinline{python}{window = 10000}, the first value of \mintinline{python}{result} is the minimum of the first 10000 points of \mintinline{python}{z}. If there is enough data around the point where the minimum is calculated, the ensemble is centered, with a window of 100, the minimal value at the 100th elements is between the 50th and 150th (\textit{e.g.} \mintinline{python}|result[100] = np.min(z[50:150])|. The raw and rescaled trajecotry are shown Fig.\ref{fig.rescaled_traj}. Of course, that technique is not perfect and we are working on a method that could directly measure the wanted wall-particle distance, also using Mie (Next chapter ?). However, subtract the moving minimum has a benefit, indeed it can remove some experimental drift that can be due of the physical movement of the optical pieces of the microscope. Moreover, as the exact location of the $z=0$ origin is thus \textit{a priori} undetermined we add to the physical parameters $B$, $\ell_\mathrm{D}$ and $\ell_\mathrm{B}$ a height offset $z_\mathrm{off}$ that account for the correction of the wall position.

	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter3/images/trajctory_analysis/traj_rescaled.pdf}
	\caption{Raw trajectory measured using the Mie tracking technique, and it's rescaled value using moving minimum algorithm with a window of $10000$ points.} 
	\label{fig.rescaled_traj}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Equilibrium distribution}

As we have done for the simulated trajectory, one can construct the equilibrium probability densitity function $P_\mathrm{eq}(z)$ of the position of the particle. As seen in Fig.\ref{fig.pdf_exp}, and explain in the previous section, an exponential tail is observed at large distance, which is identified to the sedimentation contribution in Perrin's experiment~\cite{perrin_les_2014}, but here with the probability density function of a single particle instead of the concentration field. In contrast, near the wall, we observe an abrupt depletion, indicating a repulsive electrostatic contribution. Additionally, we see that the the Gibbs-Boltzmann ditribution Eq.\ref{PDF} fits the data very well.



 Moreover, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig.ld}, we verified that we recover the Debye relation $\ell_{\mathrm{D}}=0.304/\sqrt{\textrm{[Nacl]}}$, with $\ell_{\mathrm{D}}$ in nm, and where [NaCl] is the concentration of salt in mol/L, with a prefactor corresponding to a single monovalent salt in water at room temperature~\cite{israelachvili_intermolecular_2015}. Besides, we have verified, as shown on the Fig.\ref{fig.ld}, that the dimensionless parameter $B$ related to surface charges is constant in the studied salt-concentration range, thus excluding any nonlinear effect~\cite{wang_measurement_2011,oberholzer_grand_1997} in our case.

 	\label{fig.ld}
 \end{figure}


\subsubsection{Mean Square Displacement}

We now turn to dynamical aspects, by considering the mean-squared displacement (MSD). For the three spatial directions, indexed by $i=x$, $y$, and $z$, corresponding to the coordinates $r_x=x$, $r_y=y$, and $r_z=z$, of the position $\vec{r}$, and for a given time increment $\Delta t$, the MSD is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\langle\Delta r_i(t)^2 \rangle_t = \langle[r_i(t+\Delta t) - r_i(t)]^2\rangle_t\ ,
	\label{MSDdef}
\end{equation}
where the average $\langle\rangle_t$ is performed over time $t$. For a free Brownian motion in the bulk, and in the absence of other forces than the dissipative and random ones, the \gls{MSD} is linear in time, \textit{i.e.} $\langle\Delta r_i(t)^2 \rangle_t = 2 D_0 \Delta t$, where $D_0=k_\mathrm{B}T/(6\pi\eta a)$ is the bulk diffusion coefficient given by the Stokes-Einstein relation~\cite{einstein_uber_1905}, and $\eta$ is the liquid viscosity. Further including sedimentation restricts the validity of the previous result along $z$ to short times only, \textit{i.e.} for $\Delta t\ll\ell_{\textrm{B}}^2/D_0$ such that the vertical diffusion is not yet affected by the gravitational drift.

The presence of a rigid wall at $z=0$ adds a repulsive electrostatic force along $z$. It also decreases the mobilities nearby through hydrodynamic interactions, leading to effective viscosities $\eta_\parallel(z)=\eta_x(z)=\eta_y(z)$, and $\eta_\bot(z) = \eta_z(z)$. Interestingly, despite the previous modifications, the temporal linearity of the MSD is not altered by the presence of the wall~\cite{chubynsky_diffusing_2014,prieve_measurement_1999} for $x$ and $y$, as well as at short times for $z$. In such cases, the MSD reads:
\begin{equation}
	\langle\Delta r_i(t)^2 \rangle_t = 2 \langle D_i \rangle \Delta t\ ,
	\label{averagediff}
\end{equation}
where for each spatial direction we introduced the local diffusion coefficient $D_i(z)=D_0\eta /\eta _i(z)$, and its average 

\begin{equation}
	\langle D_i(z) \rangle = \int_0^{\infty} \textrm{d}z\, D_i(z)P_{\textrm{eq}}(z) ~,
\end{equation}  

against the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution in position. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig.MSD}, the MSD measured along $x$ or $y$ is indeed linear in time. By fitting to Eq.\ref{averagediff}, using Eqs.\ref{Eq:PDF} and \ref{Eq:etax}, we extract an average transverse diffusion coefficient $\langle D_\parallel \rangle= \langle D_x\rangle=\langle D_y \rangle= 0.52\, D_0$. In contrast, along $z$, we identify two different regimes: one at short times, where the \gls{MSD} is still linear in time, with a similarly-obtained best-fit value of $\langle D_z \rangle= 0.24\, D_0$; and one at long times, where the MSD saturates to a plateau. This latter behaviour indicates that the equilibrium regime has been reached, with the particle having essentially explored all the relevant positions given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution.

	\includegraphics{02_body/chapter3/images/trajctory_analysis/msd.pdf}
	\caption{Measured mean-squared displacements (MSD, see Eq.\ref{MSDdef}) as functions of the time increment $\Delta t$, for the three spatial directions, $x$, $y$, and $z$.

	\label{fig.MSD}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Non-gaussian dynamics - Displacement distribution}

Having focused on the \gls{MSD}, \textit{i.e.} on the second moment only, we now turn to the full probability density function $P_i$ of the displacement $\Delta r_i$. Since, the diffusion coefficient $D_i(z)$ varies as a result of the variation of $z$ along the particle trajectory, $P_i$ exhibits a non-Gaussian behavior, as seen in Figs.~\ref{fig.displacement}-a,b,c,d). We even resolve the onset of a non-Gaussian behavior in $P_x$, by zooming on the large-$\lvert\Delta x\rvert$ wings. At short times, the diffusion coefficient $D_i$ and the drift velocity $\bar{v}_\mathrm{d}$, can be considered constant. By writing the initial condition $\delta(x_i - x_i ^0)$, the solution of the Forward Fokker-Plank Eq.\ref{Eq.solfokker}, becomes:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	P(x_i, z_0, \Delta t) &= \exp \left[  \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial z ^2} D_i(z_0) \Delta t - \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \bar{v}^i _\mathrm{d} (z_0) \Delta t \right] \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int _{-\infty} ^{\infty} ~ \textnormal{d}u \exp (ju(z-z_0))  \\
	&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int _{-\infty} ^{\infty} ~ \textnormal{d}u  \left[ D_i(z_0) \Delta t \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial z ^2} \exp (ju(z-z_0)) -  \bar{v}^i _\mathrm{d} (z_0) \Delta t \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \exp (ju(z-z_0)) \right] \\
	& = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} ~ \textnormal{d}u \exp \left[ -u^2 D(z_0)\Delta t + ju(z-z_0) - ju  \bar{v}^i _\mathrm{d} (z_0) \Delta t \right] ~,
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $ \bar{v}^i _\mathrm{d} (z_0)$ is non zero only for the $z$ axis. The latter can be reduced to \cite{matse_state-dependent_nodate, risken_fokker-planck_2012}:

\begin{equation}
	P_i(\Delta r_i, z_0, \Delta t) =   \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi D_i(z_0) \Delta t}} \exp \left[-\frac{(\Delta r_i - \bar{v}^i_\mathrm{d}\Delta t)^2}{4 D_i(z) \Delta t}   \right]\ .
	\label{Pdxshort}
\end{equation}

Which is a Gaussian distribution with a 0 mean value for the $x$ and $y$ axis and  
\begin{equation}
\langle P_z(\Delta z, z_0, \Delta t) \rangle = \bar{v}_\mathrm{d} \Delta t	~,
\end{equation}
for the $z$ axis. Additionally, it has a variance $\sigma_i(z_0) = \sqrt{2D_i (z_0) \Delta t}$. From Eq.\ref{Pdxshort}, we can observe than the total drift $\bar{v}_\mathrm{d}$ induces an asymmetry on the displacement along the $z$ axis. However, in our experiment, as we have access to long enough trajectory, we are interested about the distribution which is not conditioned by the initial position but by the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution Eq.\ref{Eq:PDF}. At short times, $P_i$ can thus be modeled by the averaged diffusion Green's function~\cite{matse_test_2017,hapca_anomalous_2009}:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		P_i(\Delta r_i, \Delta t) & = \int _{0} ^\infty ~\textnormal{d} z_0 P_\mathrm{eq}  P(x_i, z_0, \Delta t) \\
		&= \int ^\infty _0 \mathrm{d}z\, P_{\textrm{eq}}(z) \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi D_i(z) \Delta t}} \textrm{e}^{-\frac{\Delta r_i^2}{4 D_i(z) \Delta t}     }\ ,
	\end{aligned}
	\label{Eq:PDzshort}
\end{equation}
against the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. Which can alternatively be written as an integral over the diffusion such that:
\begin{equation}
	P(\Delta r_i , \Delta t) = \int_0 ^\infty dD_iP(D_i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi D_i \Delta t}} \mathrm{e} ^{\frac{-\Delta r_i ^2}{4D_i\Delta t}} 
\end{equation}

The latter can be evaluated using the following Python snippet.
\begin{minted}
	[
	frame=lines,
	framesep=2mm,
	baselinestretch=1.2,
	fontsize=\footnotesize,
	linenos
	]
	{python}
def P_D(B, ld, lb):
  # Computing the D PDF.
  z = np.linspace(1e-9, 15e-6, 1000)
  P_D = Dz(z) * P_b_off(z, offset, B, ld, lb)
  P_D = P_D / np.trapz(P_D, z)  # extra step to ensure PDF normalization
 return Dz, P_D


def _P_Dz_short_time(Dz, Dt, B, ld, lb):
  # Using the D PDF to compute the P()
  D_z, P_D = P_D(B, ld, lb)
  P = P_D / np.sqrt(4 * np.pi * D_z * Dt) * np.exp(-(Dz ** 2) / (4 * D_z * Dt))
  P = np.trapz(P, D_z)
  return P


# Wrapping the previous function of easier use for Dz arrays.
def P_Dz_short_time(Dz, Dt, B, ld, lb):
  P = np.array([_P_Dz_short_time(i, Dt, B, ld, lb) for i in Dz])
  P = P / np.trapz(P, Dz) # extra step to ensure PDF normalization
  return P
\end{minted}

In the latter snippet, the evaluation is done for $\Delta z$, however to compute $P_x(\Delta x)$ one should just change the \mintinline{python}{Dz(z)} function to compute the parallel diffusion coefficient $D_\parallel$. As a \gls{PDF} $P$ should be normalize such that $\int P = 1$, I added extra step to ensure \gls{PDF} noralization along the evaluation.
Since, we have reach equilibrium, the particle the overall drift of the particle should be equal to 0 thus leading to a mean value of the distribution Eq.\ref{Eq:PDzshort}, $\langle 	P_i(\Delta r_i, \Delta t) \rangle  = 0$. As shown in Figs.\ref{fig.displacement}-a,c,b,d) Eq.\ref{Eq:PDzshort} captures the early data very well. At long times, Eq.\ref{Eq:PDzshort} remains valid only for $P_x$ and $P_y$. Nevertheless, the equilibrium regime being reached, $P_z$ only depends on the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution and can eventually be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow\infty}P_z(\Delta z) = \int_0^{\infty}\textrm{d}z\,P_{\textrm{eq}}(z+\Delta z)P_{\textrm{eq}}(z)\ ,
	\label{auxiliary}
\end{equation}
which contains in particular the second moment:
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow\infty}\langle\Delta z ^2\rangle = \int _{- \infty} ^{+ \infty}\textrm{d}\Delta z\, \Delta z^2\int_0^{\infty}\textrm{d}z\, P_{\textrm{eq}}(z+\Delta z)P_{\textrm{eq}}(z) \ .   
	\label{Eq:plateau}
\end{equation}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig.displacement}-e), Eq.\ref{auxiliary} captures the long-term data along $z$ very well. Additionally, Eq.\ref{Eq:plateau} permits to fit the plateau of the \gls{MSD} as shown in the Fig.\ref{fig.MSD}. Eq.\ref{auxiliary} can be evaluated using the following Python function:

\begin{minted}
	[
	frame=lines,
	framesep=2mm,
	baselinestretch=1.2,
	fontsize=\footnotesize,
	linenos
	]
	{python}
def _Pdeltaz_long(DZ, B, ld, lb):
  z = np.linspace(0, 20e-6, 1000)    
  dP = P_eq(z, B, ld, lb) * P_eq(z + DZ, B, ld, lb)
  P = trapz(dP,z)
  return P

def Pdeltaz_long(DZ, B, ld, lb):
  pdf = np.array([_Pdeltaz_long(i,B, ld, lb) for i in DZ])
  pdf = pdf / trapz(pdf,DZ)
  return pdf

\end{minted}

Where the \mintinline{python}{P_eq} function has been described in the section \ref{Section:sphere-wall}.

\subsubsection{Local diffusion coefficient inference}

We now wish to go beyond the previous average $\langle D_i\rangle$ of Eq.~(\ref{averagediff}), and resolve the local diffusion coefficient $D_i(z)$. To measure local viscosity from experimental trajectories, a binning method is generally employed~\cite{friedrich_approaching_2011}. This method consists on constructing the displacement \gls{PDF} conditioned on the particle height, an measure the distribution's variance $\sigma_i(z_0) = \sqrt{2D_i (z_0) \Delta t}$ as in Eq.\ref{Pdxshort}. 


\begin{figure}[h!]

They evaluated the performance of these methods on the approximation of the drift field (c),e)) and diffusion field (d)f)) as a function of the number $N$ of single-molecule trajectories (similar to the ones in panel b)) used.

The performance is evaluated as the average mean-squared error on the reconstructed field along trajectories. \gls{SFI} outperforms both other methods in all cases.

	\label{fig.ronceray}
\end{figure}

Although the binning method is well suited for drift measurements, it suffers from a lack of convergence and precision when second moments or local diffusion coefficients have to be extracted. In particular, the binning method did not allow us to measure specifically the local diffusion coefficient in the key interfacial region corresponding to $z<100$~nm. Indeed, as we can observe in the Fig.\ref{fig.ronceray}-f) the diffusion error on noisy (such as experimental) data does saturate of the binning method is outperformed by a robust developed method  recently developed by Frishman and Ronceray \cite{frishman_learning_2020}. This method uses Stochastic Force Inference (\gls{SFI}), in order to evaluate spatially-varying force fields and diffusion coefficients, from the information contained within the trajectories. 

In practice, \gls{SFI} can reconstruct force and diffusion fields and measure entropy production from Brownian trajectories. \gls{SFI} is based on the communication-theory notion of capacity which is an information-theoritic bound, when the system is viewed as a communication channel, that limit at which rate information about the fields can be extracted from a Brownian trajectory. To explain the method, let us consider a Brownian particle that obey to the equation similar to Eq.\ref{Eq.langevin_confined}:

\begin{equation}
	\dot{x}_\mu = F_\mu (x) + \partial_nu D(x)_{\mu \nu} + \sqrt{2D(x)}_{\mu \nu} \partial{d}B_t~,
\end{equation}

where  the force field $F_\mu (x)$ and the diffusion tensor field $D_{\mu \nu}$ are assumed to be time-independent. This method thus is build to measure the entire diffusion matrix, which for a particle diffusing above a wall has non-zero the diagonal term (\textit{i.e.} $D_{xx}$, $D_{yy}$ and $D_{zz}$). However, for more complex environment such as cellular environment as shown on Fig.\ref{fig.ronceray}-a), non-diagonal terms exists leading to correlations between the displacement axis. As an example, it has been observed in elastohydrodynamics \cite{saintyves_self-sustained_2016} that the a parallel movement near a soft wall can induce perpendicular forces, hence leading in that peculiar case, to correlation between the $x$ and $z$ movement. The \gls{SFI} idea is to approximate the diffusion field as a linear combination of ginite basis of $n_b$ kown functions $b={b_\alpha (x)}_{\alpha = 1...n_b}$. For the diffusion of spherical spheres near a wall where the diffusion coefficient is given by the Eqs.\ref{Eq:etaz} and \ref{Eq:etax} we got robust results using their built-in polynomial basis:

\begin{equation}
	b = \{1, x_\mu, x\mu x_\nu, ...\} \text{ (up to the order } n_b \text{ )}.
\end{equation} 

They perfrom this approximation by projecting the diffusion field onto the space spanned by $b_\alpha (x)$ using the position \gls{PDF} $P_\mathrm{eq}$ as a measure. This corresponds to a least-squares fit of the diffusion field by linear combinations of the $b_\alpha$'s. To do this fit, they define a projector:

\begin{equation}
	c_\alpha (x) = B^{1/2}_{\alpha \beta} b_\beta (x) ~,
\end{equation}

where $ B^{1/2}_{\alpha \beta}$ is an orthonormalization matrix such that $\int c_\alpha c_\beta P_\mathrm{eq}(x)\mathrm{d}x = \delta _{\alpha \beta}$. They then approximate $D_{\mu \nu}$ by its projection as a linear combination of known functions:

\begin{equation}
	D_{\mu \nu} (x) \simeq D_{\mu \nu \alpha} c_\alpha (x) ~,
\end{equation}  

with,

\begin{equation}
	D_{\mu \nu \alpha} = \int D_{\mu \nu}(x) c_\alpha (x) P_\mathrm{eq} \mathrm{d}x ~.
\end{equation}

As the equation here are over a whole trajectory which is long enough to satisfy $P_\mathrm{eq}$, the empirical projector $\hat{c}_\alpha$ can be approximated using the trajectory averages. To measure the local diffusion they construct a local estimator $\hat{d}_{\mu \nu} = \Delta x_\mu (t_i) \Delta x_\nu (t_i) / 2\Delta t$, so that $D_{\mu \nu \alpha}$ now reads:

\begin{equation}
	\hat{D}_{\mu \nu \alpha} = \frac{1}{\tau} \sum _i \hat{d}_{\mu \nu} (t_i) \hat{c}_\alpha (x (t_i)) \Delta t).
\end{equation}

The latter equation corresponds to a linear regression of $\hat{d}_{\mu \nu} (t_i)$, and permits to project the diffusion tensor onto a finite set of basis functions. We implemented this method, using fourth-order polynomials in our case. to simplify the use of their method with out data, I developed a simple Python function around their method \href{https://github.com/eXpensia/StochasticForceInference/blob/master/fun_SFI.py}{\faGithub} which can infer the local diffusion coefficient by only one function call: 

\begin{minted}
	[
	frame=lines,
	framesep=2mm,
	baselinestretch=1.2,
	fontsize=\footnotesize,
	linenos
	]
	{python}

Dx, Dy, Dz, z_D = Compute_diffusion(pos)
\end{minted}

Where in the latter, \mintinline{python}{pos} is the 3D trajectory of a Brownian colloid. It allowed us to infer the local diffusion coefficients $D_i(z)$, down to $z=10$~nm, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig.visco}. The results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions, $D_{\parallel}(z)$ and $D_z(z)$, using  Eqs.\ref{Eq:etaz} and \ref{Eq:etaz}, thus validating the method.

The solid lines are the theoretical predictions, $D_{\parallel}(z)=D_0\eta/\eta_{\parallel}(z)$ and $D_z(z)=D_0\eta/\eta_z(z)$, using the local effective viscosities $\eta_{\bot}(z)$ and $\eta_\parallel(z)$ of Eqs.\ref{Eq:etaz} and \ref{Eq:etaz}, respectively.}

\subsubsection{Precise potential inference using multi-fitting technique}
So far, through Figs.\ref{fig.pdf_exp} to \ref{fig.visco}, we have successively presented the various measured statistical quantities of interest, as well as their fits to corresponding theoretical models. Therein, we have essentially three free physical parameters, $B$, $\ell_\mathrm{B}$, $\ell_\mathrm{D}$, describing the particle and its environment, as well as the \textit{a priori} undetermined location of the $z=0$ origin. These four parameters are actually redundant among the various theoretical models. Therefore, in order to measure them accurately, we in fact perform all the fits simultaneously,
using a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm that is well suited for unconstrained
nonlinear optimization~\cite{dai_convergence_2002}. To do so, we construct a global minimizer:
\begin{equation}
	\chi ^ 2 = \sum _{n=1} ^{N} \chi_n ^ 2\ ,
\end{equation}
where we introduce the minimizer $\chi _n ^2$ of each set $n$ among the $N$ sets of data, defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\chi _n ^2 = \sum _{i=1} ^{M_n} \frac{[y_{ni} - f_n(x_{ni}, \mathbf{b})]^2 }{f_n(x_{ni}\ , \mathbf{b})^2}\ ,
\end{equation}
with $\{x_{ni},y_{ni}\}$ the experimental data of set $n$, $M_n$ the number of experimental data points for set $n$, $f_n$ the model for set $n$, and $\mathbf{b}=(b_1,b_2,...,b_p)$ the $p$ free parameters. In our case, $p=4$, and $\{x_{ni},y_{ni}\}$ represent all the experimental data shown in Figs.\ref{fig.pdf_exp} to \ref{fig.visco}. 

Due to strong dependence of the normal diffusion coefficient $D_z$ with $z$, it is possible to find the wall position with a 10-nm resolution, thus overcoming a drawback of the Lorenz-Mie technique which only provides the axial distance relative to the focus of the objective lens. Besides, the three physical parameters globally extracted from the multifitting procedure are: $B = 4.8 \pm 0.6$, $\ell_\mathrm{D} = 21 \pm 1~ \mathrm{nm} $, and $\ell_\mathrm{B} = 530 \pm 2~ \mathrm{nm}$. Using the particle radius $a = 1.518 \pm 0.006 ~ \mathrm{\mu m}$ calibrated from the preliminary fits of the interference patterns to the Lorenz-Mie scattering function (see section \ref{sec:radius_charac}), and the $1050 ~ \mathrm{kg.m^{-3}}$ tabulated bulk density of polystyrene, we would have expected $\ell_\mathrm{B}=559 ~ \mathrm{nm}$ instead, which corresponds to less than $2\,\%$ error, and might be attributed to nanometric offsets, such as \textit{e.g.} the particle and/or wall rugosities. 

\subsubsection{Measuring external forces using the local drifts}
Finally, we investigate the total conservative force $F_z(z)$ acting on the particle along $z$. The first method way to measure it is to calculate the gradient of the potential $U$ which is experimentally measure from the position \gls{PDF} giving:


\begin{equation}
	F_z^\mathrm{eq} = -\nabla U = k_\mathrm{B}T \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \ln (P_\mathrm{eq}) ~,
	\label{Eq.conservative_force}
\end{equation}

where one can use the experimentally measured $P_\mathrm{eq}$ (See Fig.\ref{fig.pdf_exp}) the results of this method is shown in fig.\ref{fig.figure_force_total}. However, it can be interesting to measure the forces using the local drifts as for more complex systems, some non-conservative forces could arise. As the Eq.\ref{Eq.conservative_force} only take into account to the potential $U$, only convervative forces can be extracted from the measurement of $P_\mathrm{eq}$. For more complex system, non-conservative forces could be measured by the difference between forces obtained through $P_\mathrm{eq}$ and the local drifts.  By averaging the overdamped Langevin equation over a fine-enough $z$-binning grid and short enough time interval $\Delta t$, one gets in the ItÃ´ convention (corresponding to our definition of $\Delta z$):
\begin{equation}
	F_z (z) = 6 \pi \eta_z (z ) a \frac{\langle\Delta z\rangle}{\Delta t} - k_\mathrm{B}T \frac{D_z'(z)}{D_z(z)} \ ,
	\label{stokes}
\end{equation}
where the last term corresponds to the additional contribution due to the non-trivial integration of the multiplicative noise~\cite{volpe_influence_2010,mannella_comment_2011,mannella_ito_2012, sancho_brownian_2011}, with the prime denoting the derivative with respect to $z$. From the averaged measured vertical drifts $\langle\Delta z\rangle$, and invoking Eq.~(\ref{etaperp}), one can reconstruct $F_z(z)$ from Eq.~(\ref{stokes}), as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig1}b). We stress that the statistical error on the force measurement is comparable to the thermal-noise limit~\cite{liu_subfemtonewton_2016}: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{tnl}
	\Delta F=\sqrt{24\pi k_{\mathrm{B}}T \eta_z(z) a/ \tau_{\textrm{box}}(z)}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{\textrm{box}}(z)$ is the total time spent by the particle in the corresponding box of the $z$-binning grid. To corroborate these measurements, we invoke Eq.~(\ref{Eq:PDF}) and express the total conservative force $F_z(z)=-U'(z)$ acting on the particle along $z$:
\begin{equation}
	\displaystyle F_z(z) =  k_{\mathrm{B}}T\left(\frac{B}{\ell_\mathrm{D}} \textrm{e}^{-\frac{z}{\ell_\mathrm{D}}} - \frac{1}{\ell_\mathrm{B}}\right)\ .
	\label{Eq:Force}
\end{equation} 
Using the physical parameters extracted from the above multifitting procedure, we plot Eq.\ref{Eq:Force} in Fig.~\ref{fig.figure_force_total}. The agreement with the data is excellent, thus showing the robustness of the force measurement. In particular, we can measure forces down to a distance of $40$~nm from the surface. Besides, far from the wall, we are able to resolve the actual buoyant weight $F_{\textrm{g}} =- 7  \pm 4 ~ \mathrm{fN}$ of the particle. This demonstrates that we reach the femtoNewton resolution, and that this resolution is solely limited by thermal noise.

The solid line corresponds to Eq.~(\ref{Eq:Force}), with $B=4.8$, $\ell_{\mathrm{D}}=21\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $\ell_{\mathrm{B}}=530\,\mathrm{nm}$. The black dashed lines and grey area indicate the amplitude of the thermal noise computed from Eq.\ref{tnl}. The horizontal red dashed line indicates the buoyant weight $F_{\textrm{g}}=-7$~fN of the particle.}

\subsection{conclusion}
To conclude, we have successfully built a multi-scale statistical analysis for the problem of freely diffusing individual colloids near a rigid wall. Combining the equilibrium distribution in position, time-dependent non-Gaussian statistics for the spatial displacements, a novel method to infer local diffusion coefficients, and a multifitting procedure, allowed us to reduce drastically the measurement uncertainties and reach the nanoscale and thermal-noise-limited femtoNewton spatial and force resolutions, respectively. The ability to measure tiny surface forces, locally, and at equilibrium, as well the possible extension of the method to non-conservative forces and out-of-equilibrium settings~\cite{amarouchene_nonequilibrium_2019, mangeat_role_2019}, opens fascinating perspectives for nanophysics and biophysics.
